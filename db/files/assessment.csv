,GIN,Guinea (mining)		,mining,"Guinea’s mining sector scores 38 of 100 in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 63rd among 89 assessments and 20th among 31 assessments in sub-Saharan Africa. Failing revenue management contributes to its overall poor performance, with a score of 28 of 100 and rank of 74th place. Guinea is a low-income country with a population of 13 million and gross domestic product per capita of USD 500. The country has the world’s fourth-largest  bauxite reserves, amounting to 180 million metric tons, and is the third-largest bauxite producer and exporter in the world.  This assessment, therefore, focuses on bauxite because of its importance to Guinea’s economy, although Guinea also produces iron ore, gold and diamonds. Mining represented over 60 percent of Guinea’s total exports and 24 percent of total government revenues in 2015. ",Reforming failing revenue management would help Guinea reduce leakage of mining value,"Guinea’s enabling environment score of 37 of 100 falls just below the sub-Saharan African average of 39 of 100. Within the index’s value realization component, the country scores a weak 53 of 100, ranking 39th among 89 country assessments. With a score of 25 of 100 in national budgeting, Guinea ranks 30th among 31 sub-Saharan African countries due to a lack of fiscal rules and budget transparency.","Guinea achieves its highest subcomponent score of 62 of 100 in licensing. Yet, allocation of licenses would benefit from added transparency. Guinea awards most licenses to companies on a first-come, first-served basis. The country’s mining code also sets a process for open tendering for blocks with known geological resources, but in recent years only one open tender has been organized. The Boffa block tender had a dedicated website with information for bidders, but failed to attract competition, so the government moved on to direct negotiation with the state-owned enterprise Société Guinéenne du Patrimoine Minier (SOGUIPAMI), without disclosing negotiable terms. The mining code and its regulations set requirements for disclosure of license awards, and the online cadaster has been published in 2017.

In 2012, the government initiated a contract review process aiming to increase the sector's revenue and impact on the development of the country. The contract review process was concluded in 2016 and the government has yet to publish the results. Guinea performs satisfactorily in tax transparency but it could achieve its objectives for tax reform by using the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) as a platform to disclose information on beneficial owners, production at the project level, export and payment information and enforce the requirement to publish contracts.
",Performance gap between law and practice,"A progressive mining code was passed in 2011 and amended in 2013. Implementation of the code has, however, been slow and enforcement falls short of obligations, especially in areas that would promote benefits for the local population. This means that Guinea’s score for indicators measuring laws and regulations is 22 points higher than its score for implementation and enforcement. Furthermore, the code’s provision for 15 percent sharing of mining taxes with local governments has not yet been implemented. The code also requires companies to prepare an impact assessment covering environmental and social aspects of the project and more detailed health, safety and resettlement plans in the case of large-scale projects. However, none of these plans are disclosed to the public or affected communities. ",TRUE,TRUE,SOGUIPAMI’s poor performance is driven by a poor legal framework,"The Guinean government has a minority participation in several mining operations in the country, and the mining code allows the government to have up to a 35 percent equity share in extractive companies. The only fully state-owned enterprise, SOGUIPAMI, is one of the weakest elements of Guinea’s extractive sector. It scores 38 of 100 and ranks 14th among 27 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in sub-Saharan Africa, compared to the best performer in the region, which has a score of 75 of 100. While other policy areas in Guinea are characterized by better performance in legal framework than implementation, SOE governance features good practices, such as annual reporting and oversight by the court of audits of Guinea. It would benefit from a systematic and rules-based process on reporting on finances, as well as rules on financial transfers between SOGUIPAMI and the government. Including detail on subsidiaries' finances, production and sales and corporate governance would also improve the company's governance.",FALSE,,,,,38,"What is the RGI?

Mongolia is the smallest country in Eurasia, with a population of three million. It has 18 million metric tons of copper reserves, representing two percent of global reserves.  These copper reserves have attracted considerable investment over the past decade. According to 2015 Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) data, resource revenues represented 24 percent of government revenues. Mongolia has developed a number of policies to manage resource revenues, including the establishment of a fund and distribution of revenues via direct cash transfers, however, the recent fall of commodity prices has pushed the country in to a debt crisis. This is reflected in a weak score for revenue management, in contrast with satisfactory scores in other components of resource governance.",Mongolia performs best in Eurasia in taxation and revenue sharing ,"Mongolia’s favorable enabling environment, with strong accountability, participation and political stability, supports overall resource governance. Mongolia is strong in value realization, the component measuring governance of licensing, taxation, local impact and state participation. Mongolia performs particularly well in taxation as its tax rules are comprehensively disclosed and tax collection is overseen by the National Audit Office. Disaggregated reporting of sector data takes place via EITI, though it is not always timely. The Mineral Resources Authority of Mongolia grants licenses to mining companies primarily on a first-come, first-served basis, but a tendering process is also available, and rules for bidding for licenses have been published. While the process is transparent, disclosure of resource contracts and beneficial owners could be improved with binding rules requiring transparency, leading to an overall improvement of the licensing score of 61 of 100.","Mongolia performs well in transparency related to government finances, scoring particularly well on the index’s national budget disclosure indicator. Mongolia’s Fiscal Stability Law, enacted in 2010, specifies debt, budget balance and expenditure rules. The rules have been modified regularly, most recently in 2016, to accommodate failure to meet original budget targets. There is no independent oversight of the fiscal rules, though the government has expressed interest in setting up such an entity. Data on budget, resource revenues and debt is available, though debt data is not timely. There is no portal providing key sector datasets.

Mongolia is among the most resource-dependent EITI countries, with resource exports amounting to 67 percent of total exports in 2015.  Dependence on extractive revenues has exacerbated the impact of falling copper prices on Mongolian government revenues. According to data from the Atlas of Economic Complexity, Mongolia has the least diversified economy in Eurasia.

Sharing resource revenues plays a significant role in the debate around the mining sector in Mongolia. The government has tried different policies on sharing resource revenues, including direct cash transfers to citizens; these were later withdrawn as they proved too costly. Mongolia achieves the second-best score of 74 of 100 in the index on resource revenue sharing, behind Brazil, with transparent, if somewhat complex, sharing rules, and comprehensive disclosures. According to Mongolia’s revenue sharing regime, the central government shares a portion of royalty and license fee payments with localities where extraction takes place via various development funds according to needs-based indicators.
",Performance gap between law and practice,"Mongolia’s score for indicators measuring laws and regulations is 20 points higher than its score for implementation and enforcement. The gap between law and practice is widest in sovereign wealth fund governance, and also significant in local impact. Even though the Ministry of Nature and Environment operates a central portal where all environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are available to the public, some EIAs from joint ventures of the state-owned enterprise Erdenes Mongol have not been made public. ",TRUE,TRUE,Erdenes Mongol is less transparent than Mongolia’s overall resource sector,"Mongolia lags behind most countries in Eurasia with a score of 40 of 100 in state-owned enterprise (SOE) governance, ranking seventh among the nine Eurasian countries assessed in the index. SOE governance is also the weakest policy area in value realization.

Erdenes Mongol was founded in 2007 to manage the government’s interests in strategic mineral deposits. It holds equity shares in five of Mongolia’s largest mining assets and invests in production of copper, gold and other minerals through its subsidiaries. It contributes to government revenues via tax, royalty and dividends payments, which form part of the Mongolian Future Heritage Fund’s revenues. Although government revenues from Erdenes Mongol are disclosed in the Mongolia’s EITI reports, the company does not publish financial reports or disclose key production and sales information, including related to its subsidiaries and strategic joint ventures. The Mongolian parliament does not review these reports either, resulting in a gap in public oversight of the company’s activities.
",TRUE,Mongolia's Fiscal Stability Fund ranks 18th out of 34 sovereign wealth funds,"Mongolia’s Fiscal Stability Fund (FSF) was established in 2010 to promote fiscal stability. The FSF does not match the government’s openness record in other areas of revenue management, scoring a poor 42 of 100 and ranking 18th among 34 funds assessed in the index. The FSF does not disclose its own annual reports and these are not reviewed by the parliament, but the Ministry of Finance reports monthly on the FSF performance. Additionally, Mongolia has established a long-term savings fund, the Future Heritage Fund (FHF).

,COD,Democratic Republic of Congo (mining),mining,"The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) scores a poor 33 of 100 for overall resource governance, ranking 75th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). The DRC’s mining sector has attracted significant investments since the adoption of a new mining code in 2002. According to the country’s preliminary 2015 Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) report, the DRC ranked fifth among the world’s copper-producing countries and first in Africa (ahead of Zambia), with over one million tons of copper produced. Copper exports represented over 97 percent of the extractive sector’s contribution to total exports in 2015.  The DRC also produces gold, cobalt and diamonds. In 2014, the mining sector contributed 26 percent to domestic revenues.  Despite the importance of the mining sector in the DRC, governance challenges persist particularly in revenue management and the enabling environment.",Gap between legal framework and implementation results in poor index performance,"The DRC’s mining sector achieves its highest component score of 52 of 100 in value realization, reflecting a limited ability to raise revenue from the country’s world-class resource endowment. Lack of transparency around subnational revenue sharing, as well as lack of fiscal rules, an online data portal and disclosure of extractive resource revenue projections results in a poor revenue management score of 35 of 100. Resource governance in the DRC is further hampered by a failing enabling environment. The political context remains marked by uncertainty because elections have been not been organized in accordance with the constitution. The DRC’s satisfactory performance in taxation is a result of clear tax rules and fairly comprehensive disclosure of sector data, largely facilitated by its involvement in EITI. Tax collection practices are complex and unclear, however, as the Ministry of Finance, provincial administrations and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) all participate in revenue collection, and these entities are not regularly audited. The Ministry of Mines produces quarterly statistics on exports and production, but the country’s EITI reports are the only source of more detailed information on payments by extractive companies, and would benefit from more timely publication. ","The DRC achieves a satisfactory score of 64 of 100 in licensing. According to the DRC’s mining code, licenses are granted on a first-come, first-served basis through a process managed by the Mining License Registry. A 2011 government decree requires disclosure of contracts between the state or state-owned companies and partner mining companies, however, only some contracts are published on the Ministry of Mines website. Licenses granted by the Mining License Registry require a ministerial decree, and must be published in the government’s official journal. Information about these licenses is available in the online Mining License Registry. The DRC performs well in indicators measuring licensing process rules and compliance.",Direction of travel on key resource governance questions between 2012 and 2016,"Revenue management is one of the weakest areas of mining governance in the DRC. Lack of fiscal rules guiding saving and spending decisions, as well as non-disclosure of revenue projections, brings the national budgeting score down to a poor 33 of 100. The mining code provides a formula for sharing mining royalty revenues with provinces and municipalities, but as the gap between rules and their enforcement in this policy area indicates, the central and local governments do not disclose actual revenues shared. The only source of information on shared royalty revenues is the country’s 2014 EITI report, which shows that only a fraction of revenues due to the Katanga province were actually transferred, and none to other provinces. No progress has been made on this issue, and the change to provincial borders in 2016 resulted in added uncertainty over which provinces are entitled revenues from different mining operations. ",TRUE,TRUE,Gécamines ranks 53rd of 74 SOEs and is a locus of the DRC’s governance challenges,"Gécamines is the DRC’s largest state-owned mining company. It engages in joint ventures with private mining companies, and its revenues consist of rent and lease income, dividends, royalties and bonus payments from these partnerships. Gécamines controls a portfolio of important mining permits; when seeking a mining concession in the DRC, investors often enter into contracts with Gécamines or other SOEs rather than apply for a permit through the registry. These partnerships are not transparent with respect to selection procedures, legal and fiscal terms of contracts; the ultimate beneficiaries are also undisclosed.

Gécamines does not publish an annual report and rules governing fiscal transfers between the company and the government are not fully transparent. In particular, special rules apply to sales revenues from SOE assets, according to which these revenues are deposited to a special fund outside the public treasury. Little information is available publicly about these deposits.
",FALSE,,,"DRC ranks last globally in subnational sharing of oil revenues, and its mining sector performs only slightly better","Both the oil and gas and mining sectors in the DRC achieve low scores, 25 of 100 and 33 of 100, respectively. Resource governance in the country is characterized by a lack of balance, as performance ranges between satisfactory for taxation and poor in national budgeting and as low as failing in revenue sharing. In both oil and gas and mining, there is a lack of timely and reliable reporting supported by regular, independent audits. There is a general need for transparency in revenue flows and improvement in efforts to counter corruption and tax avoidance. To address these issues, the Congolese government participated in an EITI pilot on beneficial ownership disclosure. As a result, the country’s 2014 EITI report shows that 31 of 63 privately held mining companies and only one of six privately held oil and gas companies disclosed their “beneficial owners”—the actual individuals who profit from the companies’ activities. As part of its EITI roadmap, the government has committed to developing legal requirements that would encourage more disclosure. In SOE governance, Gécamines outperforms its oil and gas sector counterpart, Cohydro, because DRC EITI reports contain some data on Gécamines’ production and sales volumes and extensive non-operational activities. Transparency and accountability of both SOEs rely solely on the EITI process.

The gap between the two sectors is widest in subnational revenue sharing. Implementation and disclosure in the mining sector are poor but in the oil and gas sector there is no indication of implementation of the 10 percent oil revenue sharing rule of the public finance law.

This result is reinforced by a failing enabling environment and lack of transparency in revenue management. In contrast to a mature mining sector, the DRC’s oil and gas resources remain largely undeveloped. The country has proven oil reserves of just 180 million barrels, with large potential to expand in light of a 2014 reserve discovery estimated at three billion barrels. Despite advances in the exploration of the oil basins, production remains marginal at 25,000 barrels per day. The country has recently adopted a new hydrocarbons code and regulations that bring some improvements in transparency to the oil and gas sector.",DRC’s oil and gas sector is among the weakest globally in terms of local impact and revenue sharing,"The DRC’s oil and gas sector achieves its highest score in the taxation subcomponent, though lack of tax audits and parliamentary oversight undermine the transparency of actual collections. Monitoring compliance with contract terms is made difficult by partial disclosure of contracts on the Ministry of Hydrocarbons’ website, though the website has often been down. The procedure for awarding these contracts has been opaque, which is reflected in the partial score for licensing; however, the new hydrocarbons code passed in 2015 establishes a tendering procedure for the allocation of oil blocks, enhancing transparency. To date, no licenses have been granted on the basis of the new procedure. ","The weakest area of governance along the extractive value chain relates to local impact and subnational revenue sharing. DRC’s oil reserves are mostly located in the east of the country in sensitive natural environments, where exploration has caused disputes between the government, companies and environmental groups. The legal framework does not contain strong provisions for public participation in environmental and social aspects of the hydrocarbons sector. Environmental impact assessments and management plans are required to obtain a license, but are not publicly disclosed, despite the fact that the general law on environmental protection states that all levels of government should provide citizens with information on the environment. ",Performance gap between law and practice,"Equally, local communities’ rights to a portion of oil and gas revenues are not enforced. Article 221 of the 2011 Public Finance Law mandates that 10 percent of oil revenues collected by the central government should be shared with oil-producing provinces and earmarked for managing environmental impacts of the sector. There is a complete lack of information, even within the country’s EITI reports, on the implementation of this provision, resulting in the DRC oil and gas sector’s last-place ranking in the index with respect to subnational revenue sharing.",TRUE,TRUE,Cohydro is one of the least transparent state-owned oil companies ,"The DRC’s state-owned oil company, Cohydro, was founded in 2010 as part of the country’s efforts to start developing its oil and gas resources. Its mandate includes participation in oil and gas exploration via production sharing and service contracts with private companies, and the commercialization of the government’s share in oil production. Cohydro’s rank places its governance in the failing category and in the bottom 10 among 74 state-owned enterprises (SOE) assessed by the index. It has no website, and no annual financial reports are available to the public. The DRC’s EITI reports are the only window to information about the company’s finances, and of all the SOEs assessed in the index that are covered by respective national EITI reports, only the mining SOEs in Ethiopia and Myanmar are less transparent. Rules governing the fiscal relationship between the government and Cohydro are vague; the requirement for contribution to the state budget beyond taxes and dividends is not clearly specified by statutes establishing the company, nor by public financial laws. Rules on how Cohydro should sell the production share or oil collected in-kind are lacking entirely. The parliament does not exercise oversight over the company, nor is there a requirement for an independent audit of DRC’s state-owned enterprises.

The sector has been the subject of debate between the national government, which advocates for attracting investment, and environmental and social movements, concerned with local impacts and benefits. Following a longstanding internal conflict, Colombia is taking the first steps in a peace process, and achieves a satisfactory score for enabling environment. As Colombia’s coal industry is slowing due to decreases in global demand, other minerals are gaining in importance. Colombia produced 278,000 ounces of gold in 2015 , constituting three percent of the country’s total exports; this assessment focuses on gold. Other minerals produced in Colombia but not covered by the index include iron ore and nickel.",Value realization from mining is challenged by tension between central and local governments ,"Colombia’s mining sector ranks tenth among 89 country assessments in the index, and outperforms many of its Latin American and Caribbean peers in most policy areas in the extractive sector value chain. It scores a satisfactory 73 of 100 in taxation, as a result of transparent tax rules and oversight mechanisms. Colombia is an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) candidate and has committed to full EITI implementation in its Open Government Partnership national action plan. The government can continue on the path towards becoming fully EITI-compliant by publishing timely, project-level data, which will further improve performance in this area. ","Colombia’s mining sector scores 56 of 100 in licensing. Its mining code permits companies to apply for licenses on a first-come, first-served basis, which can be sometimes complemented by direct negotiation and bidding processes for strategic areas. While the Colombian government requires disclosure of contracts with mining companies, lack of public disclosure of public officials’ financial interests in extractive companies negatively affects its mining governance. Colombia performs satisfactorily or well in most indicators measuring the license award process. The legal framework governing the licensing process is currently suspended as a consequence of 2015 and 2016 constitutional court decisions, which overturned the national government’s sole authority to grant mining licenses. This enabled local authorities, through citizen consultations, to prevent the issuing of exploration permits, leading to some companies announcing halting of operations. ",Performance gap between law and practice,"Communities and civil society organizations in Colombia are demanding more local participation in resource decisions because of the social and environmental impacts of mining. The failure to implement legislation contributes to the concerns. Lack of enforcement is most extreme in terms of environmental and social issues. The gold sector is particularly prone to negative local impacts due to its artisanal and small scale nature. According to a 2011 study,   between 60 and 90 percent of mining units operated without a mining title. Rising gold prices have driven the surge of illegal mining, which has also has been a source of finance for armed conflict. Demobilization of the rebel group Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) and other armed groups could therefore result in a reduction of illegal mining if the peace agreements are fully implemented.

Despite tensions between central and subnational governments, the Colombian mineral revenue sharing mechanism ranks fifth in the index. The satisfactory score is a result of transparency around the rules and actual payments made to local governments. According to the Colombian general royalties system (SGR), mineral royalties are allocated to five special-purpose funds from which revenues are distributed. Two government online platforms, one providing information and consultation on territorial resource distributions (SICODIS) and the second, a royalties map, allow tracking of actual payments to each subnational government. The SGR was reformed in 2012, giving greater emphasis to the regional development aspects of the funds. This altered the allocation process so that subnational governments must apply to a regional board for funding for development projects. The uncertainty resulting from the varying capacity of subnational governments to formulate project proposals creates the gap between Colombia’s revenue sharing score and the best score of 78 of 100, achieved by Brazil.

",TRUE,FALSE,,,TRUE,Colombia’s sovereign wealth fund is the best governed globally,"Colombia scores 100 and ranks first in the index in sovereign wealth fund (SWF) governance. The Savings and Stabilization Fund (FAE) was established in 2012 by amendment of the constitution. Up to 30 percent of mining, oil and gas sector royalties are deposited in the fund, with the aim of saving and stabilizing against future revenue fluctuation. Withdrawals must be approved as part of the annual budget process, and are limited by law to 10 percent of the balance. To date, the government has not withdrawn the maximum annual amount, but as revenues decline due to falling oil prices, there has been debate on increasing withdrawals and decreasing allocations from the fund. FAE produces quarterly reports on its balance, deposits and withdrawals, which can also be tracked via SGRs online platform, SICODIS. The fund’s investments are limited to risk-constrained financial instruments, and are overseen by an investments committee, though the specific investment policies are not published. The annual reports are audited by the comptroller general, and the royalties’ regulatory commission presents the financial statements and results of the royalty collection mechanism, SGR, including deposits into the FAE, to the national congress. ","Colombia’s oil and gas sector is the world’s best performer in revenue management, closely followed by its mining sector","In both the oil and gas and mining sectors, Colombia performs well in revenue management, with the oil and gas sector outperforming Norway and Chile — the two best performers in overall resource governance. The 2011 Law 1473 established a fiscal rule limiting the structural deficit to one percent of gross domestic product by 2022. The deficit in 2016 still exceeded the target threshold, but Colombia is on track to meet the limit by 2022. The comptroller general’s office reviews compliance with the rule and issues commentaries, which explicitly analyze whether the budget complies with the fiscal rule and found no violation in 2015. Differences in revenue management between the two sectors emerge only in the existence of a centralized data portal for key oil and gas production and government collections data. These data are also reported at the project level in the oil and gas sector, but not comprehensively for the mining sector. Colombia’s EITI reports only disclose these data in the aggregate, though the 2013 report disaggregates it for some of the largest companies, covering a major part of the hydrocarbons sector but only some coal companies in the mining sector.

Local impact is the weakest element of Colombia’s resource governance. Colombia scores 46 of 100 in mining and 36 of 100 in oil and gas, behind all but Guatemala, Ecuador and Cuba in Latin America and the Caribbean. Environmental impact assessments are not easily available for citizens who lack detailed information about projects. Cases of non-compliance with rehabilitation requirements persist in both sectors. Land-users do not enjoy strong legal protections in case of conflict with extractive operators, and but the constitutional court has ruled for displaced people’s rights to compensation. Environmental and social groups have advocated for more transparency around these questions, but disclosure of environmental and social contributions has not progressed in a similar manner to revenue disclosures.",69,"What is the RGI?

According to the country’s 2015 Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) report, over three quarters of the Colombian government’s earnings from extractive came from the hydrocarbons sector. The government is seeking investment for further exploration in the face of depleting reserves.","By improving licensing and local impact governance, Colombia could achieve a satisfactory score in value realization ","Within the index’s value realization component—which measures governance of licensing, taxation, local impacts, and state-owned enterprises (SOEs)—Colombia performs strongest in the taxation and SOE governance subcomponents. Colombia also has the fifth-highest ranking resource revenue sharing mechanism, which distributes oil, gas and mining royalties to subnational authorities. ","The Colombian oil and gas sector’s financial regime was renewed in 2003 and uses concession contracts with clearly defined tax rates and rules. Some production sharing contracts signed under the previous financial regime still exist, and for those, terms of production sharing are defined by contracts. The national hydrocarbons commission (ANH), has published all post-2003 concession contracts as required by the access to information law. However, production sharing contracts from the preceding regime, signed by state-owned Ecopetrol, have not been disclosed. ",Direction of travel on key resource governance questions between 2012 and 2016,"In contrast, the Colombian government is weak in licensing. The ANH grants licenses for oil and gas development. The latest open bidding round was organized in 2014 and it followed ANH policies to set pre-qualification criteria, bid terms and rules. The licensing authority was moved to ANH from Ecopetrol as part of the oil and gas legal reform, but Ecopetrol still holds legacy production assets that it sold during a round in 2016, without playing a role in licensing. Colombia’s score in licensing is made lower by lack of public disclosure of beneficial owners and public official’s interests in extractive companies. However the government committed to beneficial ownership disclosure in the 2016 global Anti-Corruption Summit in London.",TRUE,TRUE,"Colombia’s sovereign wealth fund ranks first in the index but its state oil and gas company, Ecopetrol, can improve with added transparency","The national oil and gas company, Ecopetrol, performs satisfactorily, ranking 11th in the index and third in Latin America and the Caribbean, just behind Trinidad’s Petrotrin and Mexico’s Pemex. Ecopetrol reports regularly on its finances and operations via audited reports, and the relationship between the company and the government is defined in a decree. Payments made to the government are reported both in Ecopetrol and government reports, and consist of taxes, dividends and royalties payable to the ANH. The legislature does not participate in oversight of Ecopetrol.

In contrast to these good practices, Ecopetrol’s commodity sales are not governed by clear rules. This presents a considerable gap as Ecopetrol is not only responsible for selling oil produced in its own operations and partnerships, but it also sells the oil that is paid in kind by all hydrocarbons companies operating in Colombia, as in-kind royalties or production shares to the ANH. The buying and selling contract between ANH and Ecopetrol defines the price at which Ecopetrol should buy ANH oil, but does not define the price at which it should sell it. This defined price at which Ecopetrol buys from ANH forms the revenues that flow from the ANH to the royalty collection mechanism (SGR), and are distributed to the national budget and subnational governments. Ecopetrol is required to share information about its sales revenues with ANH, but this information is only used by ANH to verify payments and not disclosed to the public. The contract does not entitle ANH to know how Ecopetrol sells oil, and the company’s annual report states that most of its customers consist of refineries and commodity traders.

",TRUE,"Colombia’s sovereign wealth fund ranks first in the index but its state oil and gas company, Ecopetrol, can improve with added transparency","Colombia scores the maximum 100 points and ranks first in the index in sovereign wealth fund governance. The Savings and Stabilization Fund (FAE) was established in 2012 by amendment of the constitution. Up to 30 percent of mining, oil and gas sector royalties are deposited in the fund, with a purpose of saving and stabilizing against future revenue fluctuation. Withdrawals must be approved as part of the annual budget process, and are limited by law to 10 percent of the balance. To date, the government has not withdrawn the maximum annual amount, but as revenues decline due to falling oil prices, there has been debate on increasing withdrawals and decreasing allocations from the fund. FAE produces quarterly reports on its balance, deposits and withdrawals, which can also be tracked via SGRs online platform, SICODIS. The fund’s investments are limited to risk-constrained financial instruments, and are overseen by an investments committee, though the specific investment policies are not published. The annual reports are audited by the comptroller general, and the royalties’ regulatory commission presents the financial statements and results of the royalty collection mechanism, SGR, including deposits into the FAE, to the national congress.","Colombia’s oil and gas sector is the world’s best performer in revenue management, closely followed by its mining sector","In both the oil and gas and mining sectors, Colombia performs well in revenue management, with the oil and gas sector outperforming Norway and Chile — the two best performers in overall resource governance. The 2011 Law 1473 established a fiscal rule limiting the structural deficit to one percent of gross domestic product by 2022. The deficit in 2016 still exceeded the target threshold, but Colombia is on track to meet the limit by 2022. The comptroller general’s office reviews compliance with the rule and issues commentaries, which explicitly analyze whether the budget complies with the fiscal rule and found no violation in 2015. Differences in revenue management between the two sectors emerge only in the existence of a centralized data portal for key oil and gas production and government collections data. These data are also reported at the project level in the oil and gas sector, but not comprehensively for the mining sector. Colombia’s EITI reports only disclose these data in the aggregate, though the 2013 report disaggregates it for some of the largest companies, covering a major part of the hydrocarbons sector but only some coal companies in the mining sector.

Local impact is the weakest element of Colombia’s resource governance. Colombia scores 46 of 100 in mining and 36 of 100 in oil and gas, behind all but Guatemala, Ecuador and Cuba in Latin America and the Caribbean. Environmental impact assessments are not easily available for citizens who lack detailed information about projects. Cases of non-compliance with rehabilitation requirements persist in both sectors. Land-users do not enjoy strong legal protections in case of conflict with extractive operators, and but the constitutional court has ruled for displaced people’s rights to compensation. Environmental and social groups have advocated for more transparency around these questions, but disclosure of environmental and social contributions has not progressed in a similar manner to revenue disclosures.",71,"What is the RGI?

,MEX,Mexico (mining)	,mining,"Mexico’s mining sector ranks 19th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Its overall performance is brought down by weak revenue management, particularly in subnational resource revenue sharing. Mexico is the world’s seventh-largest gold producer and produced four million ounces of gold in 2016.  Gold constitutes one percent of Mexico’s total exports  and the wider mining sector, which also includes significant silver production, constitutes three percent.  This assessment focuses on gold mining, an industry which has seen significant growth in investment and output over the past ten years. Yet in 2015, it contributed less than one percent  of government revenues. ",Better revenue management will help Mexico to benefit from investment in gold mining ,"Mexico achieves its highest component score, 65 of 100, in enabling environment. Its Transparency Law facilitates public access to information. According to its Open Government Partnership (OGP) national action plan, Mexico has committed to establish an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) multi-stakeholder group and is preparing an action plan towards official EITI candidacy. However, other transparency issues around natural resources have been excluded from the 2016–2018 OGP action plan, generating strong criticism from civil society activists. Organized crime, corruption and human rights violations continue to pose a severe challenge to the governance of natural resources.","Mexico performs above the Latin American and Caribbean average in most policy areas. Weak performance in licensing reflects mixed results between satisfactory governance of the licensing process and the need for further reform on disclosure of financial interests and full mining concession documents. The mining administration maintains an online cadaster of licenses and concessions, which are usually awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. Mexican law allows for an award bidding contest when reserved zones are opened to exploitation, though bidding processes are rare in practice. In cases of bidding, the law states that the concession is awarded to the best economic proposal, but detailed bidding documents, including negotiable terms and award criteria, are available only for a fee. As the contents of concessions are not made public, it is difficult to evaluate the economic terms on which they are awarded. Despite a requirement to disclose mining titles, in practice the government has not disclosed the full documents. This is a crucial concern as the gap between the quality of the legal framework and implementation is high at 22 points, particularly in taxation and subnational revenue sharing. ",Performance gap between law and practice,"Mexico is weak in fiscal rules and the overall national budgeting subcomponent of the index. Although the government has made budget cuts, the annual expenditure ceiling set in the Budget and Fiscal Responsibility Law was modified in 2015 in order to accommodate expenditure growth. The government's openness is demonstrated by Mexico’s 16th place ranking in the 2015 Open Budget Index and the Ministry of the Treasury and Public Credit adequately discloses budgets and received resource revenues. However, it has not disclosed projections of mining revenues since 2011, despite significant fluctuations in contributions from these revenues to overall government revenues. Raising revenues from mining is the subject of public debate. New taxes arising from 2013 fiscal reforms have been protested by investors who are also facing lower prices and demand in the international markets, although Mexico’s mining sector has historically been open to the private sector. Civil society groups have argued that tax regulation is still not optimal for the Mexican government to raise sufficient revenue. Civil society groups have argued that tax regulation is still not optimal for the Mexican government to raise sufficient revenue.

As the tenth-most populous country in the world and second-most populous country in Latin America and the Caribbean, the quality of resource governance in Mexico affects nearly 130 million people. The Mexican mining sector lags behind neighboring countries, particularly in local impact, scoring 57 of 100 and ranking sixth in Latin America and the Caribbean and 27th in the overall index. Governance is weak in terms of protection of land-owners and users; environmental and mining laws only cover compensation but not resettlement mechanisms. It is the only country in the region, other than Guatemala, where mining project closure and rehabilitation requirements are not detailed in law.
",FALSE,FALSE,,,FALSE,,,The oil and gas sector’s complex revenue sharing system brings the sector's overall performance down,"The performance of Mexico’s two assessed sectors, oil and gas and minerals, is generally balanced, with a maximum difference of two points at component level. Gaps emerge in some policy areas, particularly transparency around revenue collection and distribution. Mexico’s oil and gas sector is a top performer in taxation, scoring 81 of 100, whereas the mining sector falls behind due to a lack of detail in reporting revenues by company and payment type. This gap in reporting has persisted over time. The Mexican government reports reserves, production and exports on a project-by-project basis through the Energy Information System (SIE). The mining sector has two online information platforms, the mining management system and the Mexican geological survey, but neither includes similar complete information.

The results show an eight-point difference in performance of the resource revenue sharing systems between the oil and gas and mining sectors. In the mining sector, the Mining Sustainable Development Fund distributes resources through a specified financial instrument. By contrast, in the oil and gas sector, the federal government shares revenues from three different funds with different rules, but these rules do not specify which agencies at the subnational level should receive the revenues. Not all state governments receive revenues from all funds and tracking all due and actual payments is challenging because of the complex system and lack of audits of transfers. This is reflected in the oil and gas sector’s lower performance in revenue sharing in the index.

,MEX,Mexico (oil and gas),oil-and-gas,"To improve the competitiveness of the oil and gas sector, Mexico launched energy reforms in 2013 that restructured state agencies and opened the sector to private investment. Following these reforms, Mexico’s oil and gas sector scores 61 of 100 in the 2017 Resource Governance Index, performing satisfactorily in value extraction and enabling environment, but weakly on revenue management. Mexico has the world’s 16th-largest oil reserves, with just under 10 billion barrels of oil.  In addition, Mexico has gas reserves estimated at 13 trillion cubic feet.  Depletion of historical oil blocks along with public investment constraints have led to a significant reduction in government revenues from the petroleum sector, from 34 percent in 2009 to 21 percent  in 2016. Oil and gas have fallen to six percent of total exports  and energy imports have increased.",Energy reform has improved the Mexican oil and gas regulator’s performance but concerns over environmental and social issues remain,"Mexico achieves its highest component scores in enabling environment and value realization. The latter is driven by good practices adopted by Mexico’s hydrocarbons regulator, the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH), in contract allocation and management. These include prequalification of bidders, disclosure of contract award criteria and rules and disclosure of contracts. Performance in licensing could be improved by strengthening these good practices with matching legal requirements. For example, while strong transparency measures require publication of terms and conditions of contracts, the hydrocarbons law does not explicitly require that the government publicly disclose executed contracts.","Civil society and academia have raised concerns that the 2013 Mexican energy reform and opening of the sector to private investors may lead to tension around socio-environmental issues.  The index results show weak performance in local impact (46 of 100), reinforcing this concern. General environmental laws require preparation and publication of environmental impact assessments; the hydrocarbons law only requires that companies should conduct social impact assessments but not that companies, or the authorities, should disclose them. In practice, the online library and gazette of Mexico’s Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) are difficult to search and navigate, making environmental impact assessments difficult to access. Additionally, procedures for project closure and rehabilitation are not specified in legislation.",Direction of travel on key resource governance questions between 2012 and 2016,"Due to falling oil prices and lack of investment, the extractive sector contribution to overall government revenues, mainly comprising revenues from oil and gas, has fallen from 34 percent in 2009  to 21 percent in 2016.  As a result, the Mexican government has grappled with balancing the national budget. It has executed budget cuts that have hit infrastructure investment and also limited the state-owned oil companies, Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex), budget. Despite attempts to control spending, the Congress modified the annual expenditure ceiling set in the Budget and Fiscal Responsibility Law in 2015 in order to accommodate expenditure growth. The law does not set a legal requirement for external oversight of compliance with the ceiling, but Mexico’s supreme audit office (ASF) and center for public finance studies (CEFP), oversee compliance in practice.

Pemex reports regularly on its finances, operations and payments to government and in this regard, operates like a private company. It reports on sales volumes and values in the aggregate and discloses general categories of customers without detailed names. The company’s good performance in the index contrasts with reported secrecy surrounding the relationship between Pemex and its service providers and subcontractors. In previous years, there have been cases of corruption and the ASF has detected irregularities in accounting; there are ongoing investigations of alleged corruption in investments on Pemex refineries.

Nigeria is one of the world’s most resource-dependent countries — oil and gas contributed the majority of government revenues and constituted 90 percent of Nigeria’s exports in 2015.  Nigeria also has the largest population on the African continent, so the oil and gas sector’s governance issues impact the wellbeing of a large number of people. Governance challenges are present throughout the extractive decision chain. Value is lost particularly in licensing and in the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation’s (NNPC) sales of government oil, as well as when revenues from oil and gas are shared and saved. Furthermore, a history of scandals involving top officials and the NNPC has plagued the sector and drawn public attention to corruption and asset recovery. Given NNPCs central role in all stages of the decision chain, improving governance of the state-owned enterprise (SOE) is crucial.",Improving transparency could help address Nigeria’s failing performance in licensing,"Licensing is the weakest link in Nigeria’s oil and gas decision chain, with a score of 17 of 100, placing it 77th among 89 country licensing assessments. This score and ranking reflect high levels of opacity in key areas of decision-making, including qualification of companies, process rules and disclosure of terms. The Nigerian government does not regularly publicly disclose government officials’ financial interests in the extractive sector or the beneficial owners of extractive companies, though it has made some early commitments to do so with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and the Open Government Partnership (OGP). The government has committed to disclosing all oil, gas and mining contracts in its “seven big wins” policy strategy and as part of its OGP action plan, but so far, it has not disclosed contracts.","Despite some progress in transparency of revenue collection over the past five years, tracking payments from oil and gas companies remains challenging. According to Nigeria’s 2014 EITI data, just over half of public revenues from oil and gas were distributed to the federal government and the rest were shared between the state and local governments. In terms of revenue sharing, Nigeria ranks 11th, alongside the United States (Gulf of Mexico) and Ecuador. The public lacks access to audited information on revenue flows to lower levels of government, and this contributes to the gap between the quality of the legal framework and actual implementation. ",Performance gap between law and practice,,TRUE,TRUE,"Despite some improvements in transparency, NNPC’s performance and accountability challenges persist ","NNPC achieves a poor governance score of 44 of 100, falling below the sub-Saharan African average, despite being the largest SOE on the continent. The corporation mainly scores well on indicators that measure elements of transparency required by EITI reporting, such as transfers to government and production volume disclosure. NNPC has recently strengthened some of its reporting practices, particularly for high-level financial data. However, the company does not disclose detailed annual reports on its finances, despite top officials having committed to doing so. Little information is publicly available, particularly concerning some of NNPC’s least efficient and most questionable activities, notably earnings by its subsidiaries, the costs of its operations and its significant spending on non-operational activities. Government agencies and external auditors have disputed NNPC’s interpretation of rules set in the Constitution and the NNPC Act governing monetary transfers between NNPC and the government. Officials exercise significant discretion around how NNPC sells the government’s share of oil production—for example, when selecting buyers, pricing exports or transferring sales proceeds to the government.",TRUE,"Nigeria performs low in oversight of key revenue collection, sharing and savings practices","Nigeria’s Excess Crude Account (ECA) is the most poorly governed sovereign wealth fund assessed by the index, ranking last alongside the Qatari Investment Authority. The government discloses almost none of the rules or practices governing deposits, withdrawals or investments of the ECA. Nigeria also has other natural resource funds, some of which are more transparent than the ECA. As the largest fund by asset balance, the ECA constitutes a vast governance concern at the end of the oil sector value chain.",,,42,"What is the RGI?

,TZA,Tanzania (oil and gas),oil-and-gas,"Tanzania’s oil and gas sector scores 53 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). In contrast to its mature mining industry, Tanzania has not yet started large-scale production of gas following the discovery of significant offshore gas deposits – currently estimated at 57 trillion cubic feet. Tanzania’s satisfactory performance in value realization, the component that measures the quality of governance in licensing, taxation, local impacts and state participation, is largely based on a legal framework that contains several important provisions on governance and transparency. As the country is not yet producing or exporting from most of these major gas fields, the relevant laws remain largely untested. Depending on progress with investment and implementation, the oil and gas industry has the potential to deliver significant benefits to one of the world’s fastest growing populations.","Despite a strong legal framework for oil and gas, early steps of implementation raise concerns over clarity ","Tanzania’s index score is slightly above the index average, and closely aligned with the average performance of other Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) countries assessed in the index. Tanzania’s composite score of 53 of 100 is a result of strong performance in value realization, scoring 65 of 100, but poor performance in revenue management, scoring 40 of 100.

Tanzania’s oil and gas sector ranks first in the index in taxation, alongside that of the United Kingdom. The government has disclosed production data on first projects and company payments in a timely and disaggregated manner. Tax rates, rules for depositing tax and other revenues to government accounts, and periodic audits are required by legislation, resulting in a good score for the legal framework. However the regime is still being developed and regulations are still being written; some of the key regulatory terms that will govern the prospective offshore project are yet to be established. This uncertainty, in combination with trends in the global gas market, is believed to have contributed to the delay in the final investment decision by a consortium of international oil and gas companies aiming to develop Tanzania’s offshore resources.
","Tanzania scores 48 of 100 points and ranks 27th in licensing, compared to the index best performer in licensing, Mozambique, with a score of 72 of 100. This result is mainly because regulations implementing Tanzania’s 2015 Petroleum Act are still being developed. As a result, specific provisions for bidding, such as disclosures of negotiable terms and names of bidders, are still missing from the legal framework. The requirements of the Tanzania Extractive Industries Transparency and Accountability Act (TEITA) of 2015, such as on beneficial ownership disclosure, should also be specified in regulations. This will help Tanzania meet its commitment under the EITI roadmap to implement beneficial ownership disclosure by 2020. According to the Ethics Act of 1995, Tanzanian public officials declare their ownership in companies but this declaration is not published.

Other weaker scores derive from a lack of implementation. For example, while the 2015 TEITA contains sound principles of transparency and public access to information, adherence to a number of key provisions is lacking. The act mandates disclosure of all mineral and petroleum contracts, though it is unclear whether this requirement includes those concluded prior to the passing of the act. However, the government has not disclosed any contracts to date. Timeliness of EITI reporting also remains a challenge.
",Performance gap between law and practice,"There is still much uncertainty on the timing and size of revenues from Tanzania’s nascent gas sector. The recently adopted revenue management framework and resource fund indicates that the country is preparing for a boom. In 2015, Tanzania passed the Oil and Gas Revenue Management Act. This act introduced fiscal rules that constrain spending of oil and gas revenues and require a balanced budget, and provide for a sovereign wealth fund to save for future generations and mitigate the effects of volatile commodity prices. In the absence of significant revenues, the fund was not operational at the time of the index assessment, although potential compliance risks are already apparent: There is currently no external body tasked with overseeing compliance. Data on budget, resource revenues and debt are available, but resource revenue data are not timely and projections are not published. For these reasons, Tanzania’s performance in revenue management is weaker than that of other fairly new oil producers like Ghana, Mozambique, and Uganda.",TRUE,TRUE,TPDC should improve on commodity sales transparency in advance of large-scale exploitation,"The Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) manages the government’s interests in the oil and gas sector, from upstream to downstream. The company was founded in the 1970s but its mandate and role have been recently specified in the Petroleum Act and Oil and Gas Revenue Management Act. Its satisfactory score is a result of a comprehensive set of rules covering financial reporting, financial transfers between TPDC and the government, and parliamentary oversight. However, reporting that takes place via the National Audit Office is not very timely. Weak reporting on joint ventures and subsidiaries as well as significant non-operational activities also negatively impact the score. A model production sharing agreement defines TPDC participation in oil and gas projects, but the law does not specify how the level of state equity is calculated. TPDC does not currently report on the modest volumes of gas that it sells. Despite TPDC’s responsibility for marketing the government’s share of future gas, the new laws do not provide clear rules on how the company should do this. ",FALSE,,,Enforcement challenges in Tanzania’s mining sector provide lessons for oil and gas ,"Performance between Tanzania’s oil and gas and mining sectors is mostly balanced, with a four-point difference in overall resource governance. The oil and gas sector’s slightly better performance, particularly in local impact and SOE governance, is the result of a more recent and well-defined (though as yet mostly untested) legal framework. For example, the Oil and Gas Revenue Management Act 2015 includes rules on TPDC’s role in public finances, compared to an absence of publicly accessible regulations for STAMICO. Rules for environmental and social protection are similar for both sectors, but in the mining sector, challenges with compliance with site rehabilitation have occurred whereas closure and rehabilitation have not yet taken place in the oil and gas sector.

Tanzania is Africa’s fourth-largest gold producer; this assessment focuses on gold mining, based on data collected during 2016. Tanzania has a mature mining industry. In the 2013–14 fiscal year revenues from gold mining constituted 80 percent of the extractive industries’ 12 percent contribution to Tanzanian government revenues.  Concerns over equitable distribution of benefits between investors, the government and local communities has led the Tanzanian government to take steps towards improving governance and transparency. Some of these measures, such as improved access to sector data, are captured by this assessment. Others, such as renegotiation of contracts, are not. The results point to a need to close the gap between legal requirements and enforcement across a large number of areas, and more specifically, to address shortcomings in licensing and state-owned enterprise (SOE) governance.",Tanzania must close the gap between law and practice in order to improve governance,"Tanzania ranks 18th among 34 country mining sectors and 13th among 31 assessments in sub-Saharan Africa. While Tanzania only scores a weak 50 of 100 in licensing due to limited transparency of license allocation rules, it achieves a good score of 87 of 100 in taxation. Tax rates are disclosed in laws, and production, export and company payment data are disclosed via the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and Tanzania Mineral Audit Agency (TMAA) reports. The Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) is regularly audited. These measures, supported by the Tanzania Extractive Industries Transparency and Accountability Act (TEITA), have increased transparency and accountability in this area. However, non-disclosure of contracts and lack of timely reporting prevent a robust assessment of whether the country are receiving a fair share from the mining sector. A range of stakeholders continue to raise longstanding concerns around the tax concessions provided to companies and potential tax avoidance. The results also point to a need to address social and environmental concerns related to gold mining in Tanzania, with the country only achieving a weak score in local impact. Such concerns are exacerbated by the inability of the public to access environmental impact assessments free or charge.","Tanzania’s mining sector achieves a relatively low score in revenue management. The Oil and Gas Revenues Management Act of 2015 includes rules for managing public finances and balancing the budget beyond extractive revenues. These rules were not operational at the time of the RGI assessment, but potential compliance risks are already apparent. There is currently no external body tasked with overseeing compliance, although there is a Parliamentary Budget Office tasked to analyse the government’s draft budgets. Data on budget, resource revenues and debt are available, but the timeliness of mining revenue data needs improvement and revenue projections are not published. There is no portal providing comprehensive data for either petroleum or mining. ",Direction of travel on key resource governance questions between 2012 and 2016,"Tanzania’s score for indicators measuring laws and regulations is 26 points higher than its score for implementation and enforcement, one of the highest differences among assessments in the index. The lowest-scoring subcomponents of enabling environment, specifically control of corruption and government effectiveness, point to a need for reform in those areas. The current administration has recognized this in its commitments and actions.

Continued transparency improvements will lead to a more informed assessment of the distribution of benefits between investors, the government and local communities, and better identification of any necessary reforms. The TEITA contains important provisions in this area, including disclosure of contracts and the identities of beneficial owners. Success now depends on the government creating specific rules and enforcing them.

Despite the overall partial performance, Tunisia’s mining sector ranks sixth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The phosphate mining industry is prone to environmental challenges and this is reflected in Tunisia’s weak performance in terms of local impacts. Since the 2011 Tunisian revolution, governance of the oil, gas and mining sectors has featured prominently in discussions about reform in the country.

This result is driven by a score of 80 of 100 in taxation, the highest of all assessed MENA countries in this policy area. Despite scoring highly compared with its neighbors, Tunisia is still some way behind the index best score of 92 of 100, mainly due to lack of company-level disclosure of taxes and payments. The local impact subcomponent lowers the value realization score due to lack of transparency around documents, such as environmental impact assessments.

In 2016, Tunisia government disclosed all contracts with oil and gas companies, achieving a full score of 100 on contract disclosure practice. However, the government’s recent draft amendment of the hydrocarbons code did not include provisions for mandatory disclosure of contracts. The absence of a legal framework for contract disclosure has already resulted in a failure to publish in the official gazette or the open data portal contract extensions concluded in 2016. In 2014, following a constitutional review, Tunisia reformed its licensing regime and put in place a legal requirement for parliamentary approval for oil and gas contracts. Implementing this requirement by passing a revised hydrocarbons code has since stalled, and no new contracts have been approved by parliament since 2014.
",Performance gap between law and practice,"Tunisia does not perform as well in revenue management because the country lacks explicit fiscal rules that control revenues and spending. Tunisia has established a data portal containing information on production and exports; the country could develop this further to match global best practice by including resource reserve data. Tunisia does not currently have specific mechanisms for sharing extractive resource revenues with subnational authorities.

In the Asia-Pacific region, it ranks second behind India, and just above its own oil and gas sector. Indonesia’s mining and oil and gas sectors perform well in revenue management, both scoring a satisfactory 76 of 100, whereas mining sector resource governance is weakened by problems in value realization and enabling environment. Low commodity prices, a slowdown in global demand and mineral depletion have put pressure on Indonesia’s coal-dominated mining industry. This assessment focuses on copper; Indonesia has the world’s eighth-largest copper reserves with 25 million metric tons and in 2016, it contributed four percent of global copper production.  Copper constituted eight percent of its exports.  ",Licensing procedures are an exception among generally satisfactory governance performance,"The Indonesian mining industry performs well in revenue management. The government discloses national budgets, revenues and expenditures, and for the past two years has followed the fiscal rule limiting the general government deficit to three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and public debt to 60 percent of GDP. Despite a risk of pro-cyclicality, the Indonesian government has managed to use this fiscal rule to lower public debt and adjust government spending following a more modest revenue outlook. ","In contrast, the index results point to a need for better performance in value realization, which measures governance of licensing, taxation, local impacts and state-owned enterprises (SOE). The mining sector’s score of 34 of 100 in the licensing subcomponent places it nearly 40 points below the best country performer in the index. This score is due to a lack of disclosure of financial interests, beneficial owners and contracts. Despite improvements following the clarification of roles of national and local authorities in granting licenses, rules defining the method and process of granting licenses are still absent. According to 2013 regulations, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources should award licenses via an open tender process with pre-qualification of bidders and disclosure of biddable terms — but no open tender has taken place to date. Instead, the ministry awards licenses via auctions, and has not disclosed pre-qualification and other criteria for license award for each auction listed on the government’s portal.

Indonesia’s mining law is undergoing revision in 2017 and could potentially address issues related to licensing and fiscal terms. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has started converting contracts into special mining licenses, which come with additional requirements for higher domestic ownership share and an export ban on raw ore, the purpose of which is to add more value to production through local processing.
",Performance gap between law and practice,"Indonesia’s weak performance in governance of local impacts is the result of a large gap between laws and actual practice. Despite rules requiring disclosure, no information on environmental impact assessments, mitigation plans and compliance with rehabilitation procedures is publicly available. Suspensions and closures of coal mines following cost-cutting measures have sparked public discussion over better governance of the environmental impacts of mining. A similar gap between law and practice exists in most policy areas in Indonesia assessed by the index. On average across the extractive sector governance components, the legal framework scores 79 of 100 in contrast to a practice and disclosure score of 61 of 100.

,IDN,Indonesia (oil and gas),oil-and-gas,"Indonesia’s oil and gas sector scores a satisfactory 68 of 100 and ranks 12th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). As in the mining sector, Indonesia’s oil and gas sector is better governed in revenue management than in value extraction, achieving its highest score of 76 of 100 for revenue management. As the third-most populous country in Asia, Indonesia has a large domestic market for energy and other oil-based products, which has facilitated downstream development of the mature oil and gas industry. Indonesia’s oil production makes up one percent of global oil output.  In 2015, fuel exports constituted over 20 percent of the country’s total exports. ",Indonesia’s oil and gas legal reform should address weaknesses in licensing and local impact and preserve good practices in taxation,"Indonesia scores 65 of 100 and ranks 27th in the index’s enabling environment component. Political stability and control of corruption are the weakest areas, however several planned reforms have the potential to boost Indonesia’s governance setting if carried out according to commitments. Indonesia is about to start operationalizing its beneficial ownership disclosure roadmap, using the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) standard to guide the development of regulation covering the extractive and other sectors. Indonesia is an Open Government Partnership member and generally performs satisfactorily on measures of government openness. In the open data subcomponent, Indonesia scores 69 of 100. Furthermore, it ranks in the top quarter among 102 countries assessed in the 2015 Open Budget Index. Indonesia has also committed to implementing the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and G20 anti-corruption principles.","The Indonesian government is currently reviewing the country’s petroleum law with a focus on licensing, the fiscal regime, revenue sharing and state-owned enterprise (SOE) governance. Government officials can use the index results to help guide their focus. Lack of transparency in contracts and financial interests lowers Indonesia’s score in value realization. In contrast, Indonesia’s oil and gas sector is one of the best performers in the index in terms of taxation. Government regulation 79/2010 on cost recovery and income tax for oil and gas activities governs Indonesia’s oil and gas production sharing agreements and defines key fiscal terms for these agreements. While reviewing fiscal terms may be necessary to attract investment in the context of low oil prices and the higher cost of future projects, Indonesia’s good taxation score suggests that any changes should be carefully assessed to avoid jeopardizing the benefits of the current system.",Direction of travel on key resource governance questions between 2012 and 2016,"Indonesia has made some progress in disclosing payments collected from extractive companies since 2012. Company-level payments are disclosed via national EITI reports, which means that disaggregated reporting is not as timely as the annual reporting by the Ministry of Finance, which discloses combines revenues. These positive trends contrast with a lack of progress in contract disclosure, which makes it difficult for citizens to hold the government and companies accountable for compliance with contract terms.

Notable progress has also been made in disclosure of subnational transfers of resource revenues via the Ministry of Finance’s SIMTRADA database. Indonesia scores 73 of 100 and ranks among the best performers globally in subnational resource revenue sharing, and is the best in the Asia-Pacific region. This good performance is driven by clarity and transparency of the revenue sharing regime, although disclosure of revenues shared are not separated by revenue stream, as required by the rules for sharing according to the 2015 Ministry of Finance regulation. Issues that are expected to be further clarified in the new oil and gas regulation relate to the relationship between decentralization of government and current revenue sharing regime, as well as exposure to revenue volatility at subnational level.
",TRUE,TRUE,Indonesia’s state-owned energy company Pertamina can improve governance by reducing its non-operational activities and disclosing more information about commodity sales,"Wholly owned by the Indonesian government, Pertamina is a vertically integrated energy company involved in oil, gas and renewable energy production and refining. Its operations are funded by retained earnings and a budget allocation. Pertamina engages in significant non-operational activities by bearing the cost of subsidizing fuel for Indonesian consumers, but its financial report only discloses the total cost of all non-operational activities. The Indonesian parliament does not exercise oversight of these costs. Indonesia is one of five EITI countries about to begin a pilot project on commodity trading transparency. Reporting details of hydrocarbon sales to international buyers will help to improve Pertamina’s value realization results; presently, Pertamina only reports on aggregate volume and value of sold oil. ",FALSE,,,Indonesia’s two sectors perform most similarly among countries in the index assessed on two sectors,"In most countries where the index assesses both mining and oil and gas sectors, performance between the sectors is similar, and Indonesia demonstrates the most balanced dual-sector results. Both sectors achieve the same scores on overall resource governance and its three components. Differences emerge only at subcomponent level. Indonesia’s oil and gas sector performs better in taxation due to more disaggregated and timely disclosure of key production and export data.

,GHA,Ghana (mining),mining,"Ghana’s mining sector scores 56 of 100 points and ranks 24th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). The sector performs better than most others in sub-Saharan Africa, mainly because of a satisfactory enabling environment, however, performance in revenue management is poor. This assessment focuses on gold mining; gold accounts for 14 percent  of Ghana’s mineral exports, however government revenues from the sector have declined and been surpassed by income from oil and gas.  The recent discovery of and focus on hydrocarbons has resulted in governance issues in the mining sector receiving less attention, leading to an 11-point performance gap between the two sectors.",Ghana’s mining sector performs well in value realization but poor in revenue management,"Ghana's favorable enabling environment provides a good foundation for resource governance. Building on several extractive industry-related laws, the 2016 Companies Amendment Act is an example of comprehensive legislation requiring the creation of a national register with details on beneficial owners of companies. An ever opening space for the media and civil society is reflected in Ghana’s position within top ten countries on voice and accountability.","The mining sector performs satisfactorily in the value realization component, however, performance within this component is variable, ranging from poor governance of state-owned enterprises (SOE) to satisfactory performance in taxation and management of local impact. With a score of 62 of 100 points in licensing, Ghana’s mining sector outperforms most neighboring countries in sub-Saharan Africa, ranking fifth among 31 countries assessed. The country’s minerals commission grants licenses on a first-come, first-served basis; the commission launched an online minerals cadaster administration system in 2016 through which companies can view and apply for licenses. The Ghanaian government could address questions over mining companies’ tax obligations and environmental responsibilities by requiring and enforcing disclosure of mining development agreements, some of which are governed by stabilization clauses.

The gold sector consists of a few large companies and many artisanal and small-scale (ASM) miners. In an attempt to develop the sector, Ghana has introduced local content requirements on procurement and employment. Proposed amendments to the Minerals and Mining Act of 2006 include larger fines for illegal artisanal mining. The index results indicate that governance of local impact could be improved by introducing a requirement for social impact assessments and enforcing compliance with environmental requirements. For example, the Akoben Program, an Environmental Protection Agency environmental performance rating and disclosure initiative, has reported lack of compliance with mining site rehabilitation requirements.
",Direction of travel on key resource governance questions between 2012 and 2016,"Revenue management is the weakest element in governance of Ghana’s mining sector. Ghana’s score of 36 of 100 in national budgeting results from the absence of numerical fiscal rules setting a binding constraint on overall public finances. Ghana also does not have an open data portal providing key mining sector datasets. Ghana performs poorly and ranks 23rd among 33 country assessments that are assessed for their subnational revenue sharing mechanisms. Rules for sharing mineral revenues via the Mineral Development Fund are clear, but disclosures of revenues shared are not timely or audited. ",TRUE,TRUE,"Ghana’s gold mining company scores far below its petroleum sector peer and parent company, GNPC","Ghana has two mining sector SOEs, Sankofa Prestea Mining Company and Precious Minerals Marketing Company. Additionally, the state has minority shares in ten private mining companies. The largest of the majority-owned SOEs, Sankofa Prestea, extracts gold from tailings and is not one of the major gold miners in Ghana in terms of production volume. Even though Sankofa Prestea is 90 percent owned by the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC), its activities and finances are governed in a less transparent manner than GNPC’s. Ghana’s mining and oil SOEs have the widest gap in scores among all countries with two sectors assessed in the index.

Sankofa Prestea’s performance is below average compared to other mining and Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) countries and near average compared to SOEs in sub-Saharan Africa. Its financial position is reported as part of a consolidated GNPC annual report, but operational information on production, joint ventures, and sales are not disclosed to the public. EITI country reports only shed light on production figures. Sankofa Prestea’s index score is 49 points below the highest-scoring mining SOE, Chile’s Codelco, which discloses all of the above information, apart from details on commodity sales. Like its parent company GNPC, Sankofa Prestea has engaged in non-operational activities by financing public infrastructure projects.
",FALSE,,,Ghana has the largest difference in the index between oil and gas and mining sector performance,"As in most dual-sector countries assessed by the index, Ghana’s oil and gas sector exhibits better governance than its mining sector. In Ghana this difference is due to revenue management practices. The government has published information on the oil and gas sector, including projections on oil revenues, but has not done the same for the mining sector. Following the passage of the Petroleum Revenue Management Act in 2011, which created institutions to support transparency and accountability for petroleum revenues, civil society organizations have advocated for a minerals revenue management act. Ghana’s petroleum funds top the rankings for transparency and accountability measures and contributes to the good revenue management score in the oil and gas sector. In the mining sector, however, lack of disclosures and audits of subnational revenue sharing bring revenue management performance down.

Ghana performs well in taxation in both sectors due to good disclosure of extractive sector data, transparency of tax rates in legislation, and audits of companies and the national tax authority. The mining sector’s taxation score of 72 of 100 points is slightly lower than the oil and gas sector’s score because of the absence of a legal requirement to disclose extractive companies’ payments to the government. Disclosure of company payments is also less timely in the mining sector because this information is released via Ghana EITI reports that have not been timely.

",
,GHA,Ghana (oil and gas),oil-and-gas,"Ghana’s oil and gas sector scores a satisfactory 67 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), making it the best performer in sub-Saharan Africa. Ghana has a favorable enabling environment and also performs well in revenue management. Its sovereign wealth fund is the second-best governed among 34 funds assessed in the index. Furthermore, Ghana’s Petroleum Revenue Management Act allocates oil revenues transparently between the budget, the national oil company and two funds. Yet, Ghana has accumulated a large budget deficit and borrowed heavily against future oil revenues, even though oil revenues presently constitute only four percent of total government revenues. This has revealed that Ghana’s rules for managing petroleum revenues are disconnected from those governing broader public finances.",Poor performance in national budgeting reflects Ghana’s challenges with public financial management,"Ghana’s oil and gas sector performs consistently across all three components of resource governance—value realization, revenue management and enabling environment. However, within the revenue management subcomponent, its performance varies considerably between 93 of 100 points in sovereign wealth fund governance and 36 of 100 in national budgeting.","Poor performance in national budgeting reflects the challenge of developing rules that link petroleum revenues to general public financial management. The Petroleum Revenue Management Act (PRMA) establishes a rule governing the balance between saving and spending of petroleum revenues. However, these rules have not stopped Ghanaian officials from borrowing against projected oil revenues, changing the rules themselves, and over-estimating revenues. Amendments to the PRMA in 2015 allocated more resources to the Public Interest and Accountability Committee (PIAC), a citizen’s oversight body, thereby strengthening reporting and accountability around petroleum revenues. But the amendments did not address the weaknesses of the overall framework outlined above.

This example shows that rules that only govern the share of government revenues deriving from petroleum revenues do not qualify as numerical fiscal rules setting a binding constraint on borrowing and spending—such constraints are considered an important feature of sound public financial management. Recent proposals to use oil revenues to fund social services, such as health and education, should also therefore be viewed in the context of overall budget sustainability. Legislators are expected to pass fiscal rules that set constraints on borrowing and spending as part of the upcoming Fiscal Responsibility Law.

The PRMA does not provide for sharing of oil and gas revenues with subnational authorities and hence subnational revenue sharing is not assessed as part of Ghana’s oil and gas sector governance. However, some communities and traditional authorities adjacent to offshore oil and gas projects have demanded a share of oil revenues.
",Performance gap between law and practice,"Over the course of the 2015–2016 period, Ghana introduced a host of new legislation to govern its oil and gas sector. The Exploration and Production Act of 2016 defines rules for competitive bidding for oil blocks. However, until regulations implementing the act are released, the rules for the new bidding process remain vague, as do the details relating to the requirement to disclose contracts. Other legal reforms that impact governance include the (Amendment) Companies Act 2016 which creates a national database of beneficial owners in Ghana. The register is not yet publicly available.

A weak score of 58 of 100 points in local impact reflects the absence of disclosure of environmental impact assessments and environmental mitigation management plans. Following the introduction of the aforementioned laws, yet to be fully operationalized, Ghana performs slightly better in indicators measuring laws and regulations than those measuring practice and implementation.
",TRUE,TRUE,Ghana’s state-owned oil company is well governed but should aim even higher,"The Ghana National Petroleum Corporation scores 75 of 100 points and ranks eighth among state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the index, compared to the global average of score of 49. This result is due to Ghana’s rules on fiscal transfers between GNPC and the government established in the PRMA, disclosure of these transfers, parliamentary and audit oversight requirements, and disclosure of information on subsidiaries and joint ventures. However, GNPC scores 15 points less than the best SOE performer in the index, Chile’s Codelco. This differential reflects GNPC’s spending on non-operational activities and the absence of rules or transparency around commodity sales. ",TRUE,Ghanaian Stabilization Fund is world’s second best governed,"The 2011 Petroleum Revenue Management Act created two petroleum funds. The RGI assesses the larger of these, the Ghana Stabilization Fund, which takes second place in the index’s ranking of sovereign wealth funds, behind Colombia’s savings and stabilization fund. Good performance is a result of clearly defined rules for deposits, withdrawals and investments, audit and parliamentary oversight mechanisms and adherence to these requirements. In practice, however, Ghana’s finance minister has placed a cap on the stabilization fund that has been consistently lowered in annual budgets. Furthermore, distribution of assets in which the fund invests are not disclosed in the Stabilization Fund’s annual report. ",Ghana has the largest difference in the index between oil and gas and mining sector performance,"As in most dual-sector countries assessed by the index, Ghana’s oil and gas sector exhibits better governance than its mining sector. In Ghana this difference is due to revenue management practices. The government has published information on the oil and gas sector, including projections on oil revenues, but has not done the same for the mining sector. Following the passage of the Petroleum Revenue Management Act in 2011, which created institutions to support transparency and accountability for petroleum revenues, civil society organizations have advocated for a minerals revenue management act. Ghana’s petroleum funds top the rankings for transparency and accountability measures and contributes to the good revenue management score in the oil and gas sector. In the mining sector, however, lack of disclosures and audits of subnational revenue sharing bring revenue management performance down.

Ghana performs well in taxation in both sectors due to good disclosure of extractive sector data, transparency of tax rates in legislation, and audits of companies and the national tax authority. The mining sector’s taxation score of 72 of 100 points is slightly lower than the oil and gas sector’s score because of the absence of a legal requirement to disclose extractive companies’ payments to the government. Disclosure of company payments is also less timely in the mining sector because this information is released via Ghana EITI reports that have not been timely.

Greater variance can be observed at the subcomponent level: Papua New Guinea’s performance ranges from a satisfactory score of 60 of 100 in taxation to a poor score of 39 in licensing. Governance of its taxation system stands out because of satisfactory transparency around production and exports, and good disclosure of company payments.","On average, countries in the Asia-Pacific region perform poorly in licensing; Papua New Guinea’s lowest score comes in this category due to its poor implementation of licensing rules. According to the country’s mining law, licenses are granted on a first-come, first-served basis, but in practice tax and other non-trivial contract terms have been negotiated by investors and the government. Contracts and tax terms of the resulting development agreements are confidential, making the licensing process opaque.

",Performance gap between law and practice,"Yemen achieves a failing score in national budgeting and provides little information on government budgets, revenues and expenditures. The government has not set fiscal rules that govern the spending of oil revenues. In response to low oil prices, the government has reduced spending and suspended a public investment program and cash assistance to the poor. It has also reduced spending on basic social services—such as education, health, water and electricity—resulting in a complete suspension of diesel- and fuel oil-powered stations.

Its performance varies considerably across the value chain, with scores ranging from good in the taxation subcomponent to poor in licensing and national budgeting. Ethiopia outperforms most countries in sub-Saharan Africa in taxation, ranking eighth of 31 assessed countries. Its good score in taxation is a result of its Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative-facilitated disclosures of production, exports and company payments, as well as of satisfactory accountability measures (such as audits, which are performed regularly).","Resource governance in Ethiopia is characterized by a discrepancy of 19 points between legal frameworks and their practical implementation.

Mozambique’s success in licensing is attributable to its good cadaster, good pre- and post-licensing practices and transparency about contracts. ","National budgeting is a major weakness in Mozambique’s extractive industry decision chain. There is still much uncertainty regarding the timing and size of revenues from its nascent gas sector (the government embarked on secretive borrowing on the back of these future revenues, leading to the accumulation of public debt). The country can enhance the transparency of its national budgeting by passing oil and gas revenue management legislation, including adopting and enforcing fiscal rules (as Uganda and Tanzania, also new oil and gas producers, have recently done).
There is a discrepancy of 18 points between legal frameworks and their practical implementation in Mozambique.

India is the highest-ranked country in the value realization component in the Asia-Pacific region (however, political instability poses risks to the governance of the sector). The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons is responsible for the development of the oil and gas sector.

India ranks first in the region in local impact thanks to well-defined requirements for environmental impact assessments, rules for environmental risk mitigation plans and compensation to land owners.
India also performs well in national budgeting. India`s fiscal rule sets a budget balance target in the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act 2003. The rule was suspended and amended in 2015, setting out new target to be reached by 2018. The Comptroller and Auditor General is mandated with the oversight of the rule. By contrast, India performs weak in subnational revenue sharing due to a lack of detailed disclosures about revenues shared with states.

",Performance gap between law and practice,"India achieves a better average score in indicators measuring practices than those measuring laws. In this respect, India performs similarly to other high performers, like Australia and Norway. This trend is particularly true in licensing: India has operated competitive and transparent licensing processes (the latest took place in 2012). However, neither the New Exploration Licensing Policy nor the reformed Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy require the disclosure of biddable terms and details of license winners.
Thus, governance can be improved by strengthening licensing rules pre- and post-award and by improving transparency about financial interests and contracts.

The recent lifting of sanctions against Iran creates an opportunity to attract investment and develop the country’s oil and gas resources. ,Sector governance can be enhanced in several categories,"Iran’s poor ranking in the index is a result of poor showings in value realization (36 of 100 points) and enabling environment (34 of 100 points). While government effectiveness is satisfactory, Iran faces political rights-related challenges that lead to a failing score of 11 of 100 points in voice and accountability. Iran’s weak overall performance in revenue management encompasses both high and low results—it scores a satisfactory 70 of 100 points for the governance of its sovereign wealth fund, but scores 20 of 100 points in national budgeting. Besides improving transparency around its national budget, Iran can further enhance revenue managment by adopting and enforcing fiscal rules and being more transparent about the level of its national debt.
Iran’s energy industry is in dire need of investment. The recent lifting of sanctions following the nuclear deal has attracted the interest of international oil companies from around the world, but no contracts have been signed yet. Rules for licensing rounds are fairly robust, but information on the licensing process has not been fully disclosed.

","Resource governance in Iran is characterized by a discrepancy of 20 points between legal frameworks and their practical implementation. While post-licensing rules and taxation rules are good, their practical implementation is failing. Active enforcement of these existing rules could enhance its resource governance significantly. Both legal frameworks and their enforcement require strengthening in the areas of financial interest disclosure, taxation authority, environmental impact assessments and environmental compliance.",Performance gap between law and practice,"Iran is in a relatively strong position to weather low oil prices, given its smaller share of oil revenue in the government budget and GDP, a positive non-oil trade balance and (growing) economic activity outside the energy sector, as well as access to billions of (previously blocked) U.S. dollars in international banks, as part of the implementation of the Iran nuclear deal.",TRUE,TRUE,Iran’s National Iranian Oil Company ranks last in the Middle East and North Africa region,"Iran’s state-owned oil company, the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), scores 22 of 100.

,KGZ,The Kyrgyz Republic (mining),mining,"The Kyrgyz Republic scores 51 of 100 in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Natural resources form a significant part of the Kyrgyz Republic’s economy; the country has 20 million ounces of gold reserves,1 representing one percent of global reserves. The government of the Kyrgyz Republic has been undertaking reforms towards greater transparency in mineral resource governance and public financial management, which boost index performance in licensing, taxation and revenue sharing. However, local impact and state-owned enterprise (SOE) governance lag behind. The Kyrgyz Republic’s index score is lowered by the enabling environment, particularly rule of law and control of corruption.",Reforms improve transparency and openness in the Kyrgyz Republic,"The Kyrgyz Republic’s performance across the two extractive sector components, value realization and revenue management, is fairly even. However, its ranks at the subcomponent level vary considerably, from 16th in taxation to 65th in local impact, among 89 assessments.","A good score in taxation can be attributed to timely disclosures of key extractives data. The Ministry of Finance also operates an internet portal, “Open Budget”,  which provides information on each payment type and detailed receipts sent to the state budget from each taxpayer on a monthly basis. However, the government does not disclose comprehensive resource information, such as production, sales prices or exports for each medium and large-scale mining projects. Despite a generally transparent tax regime, rules for the level of participation by state-owned companies are not enshrined in law or policy. The Kyrgyz Republic ranks sixth among 89 assessments in licensing. License information is disclosed via an interactive map of licensing areas operated by the State Committee of Industry, Energy and Subsoil Use.  However, there are no strong legal requirements for these disclosures. This highlights the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative’s (EITI) importance in upholding and pushing the country towards greater transparency, for example, beneficial ownership disclosure commitment takes place via the EITI rather than a national law.
In contrast, the Kyrgyz Republic scores a poor 38 of 100 in local impact, behind Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Mongolia, and Russia. Under the Law on Environmental Protection, impact statements and mitigation plans are required prior to project development, but there is no legal requirement for final environmental impact assessments (EIA) to be disclosed after a consultation process; final EIA statements are not publicly available either. While “social package” agreements are required to outline sharing of benefits with local communities, they only apply to tender items and EIAs only loosely cover social aspects, and do not comprise full social impact assessments (SIA). The legal framework on protecting community rights from interference of extractive projects only covers compensation, but not resettlement of populations. Compliance with environmental rehabilitation upon project closure does not always take place.
Resource producing regions in the Kyrgyz Republic enjoy resource revenues via direct revenue collection and transfers of a share of royalties and part of the tender/auction value to these regions. The resource revenue-sharing regime is clear and transparent, and the total amount of all subnational transfers is available via the Ministry of Finance’s budget execution report for the fiscal year 2015*. Accountability over the fairness of revenues shared and efficiency of spending would require improvement in the details of disclosures – a legislated requirement as of 2017.
",Performance gap between law and practice,"The Kyrgyz Republic has some gaps in national budgeting. The annual budget, expenditures and revenues, and forecasts are disclosed, and budget deficit guidelines are included in the medium-term fiscal framework, but are not binding. The Law on External and Internal Public Debt sets a debt limit rule, which has been violated in 2015 and 2016, as public debt to gross domestic product exceeded 60 percent*. There is no online data portal containing information on reserves, production and exports. Kyrgyz Republic fares decently in the Open Budget Index, ranking 34th among 101 countries.",TRUE,TRUE,Operational reporting and details of governance practices would improve Kyrgyzaltyn’s weak performance,"Kyrgyzaltyn Open Joint Stock Company (OJSC) is the largest state-owned mining company in the Kyrgyz Republic, specializing in the development of gold fields. Kyrgyzaltyn holds a share in the Canadian Centerra Gold Inc., which operates the largest gold project in the Kyrgyz Republic via its subsidiary, Kumtor Gold Company. Kyrgyzaltyn operates as a commercial legal entity independent from the state and there is no legal basis for it to be funded from the state budget. It also has to tender for projects in the same way as private companies.
Despite this apparent independence, Kyrgyzaltyn could improve in transparency, particularly in how it sells gold, and how decisions are made on the amounts of dividends that are transferred to the national budget. The State Property Management Fund holds shares in Kyrgyzaltyn on behalf of the government and thus appoints board members, however, there are no clear provisions (apart from general qualification requirements) on who can or cannot be a member of the board of directors, including whether they need to be independent of the government or not.

Peru achieves its best score in value realization, scoring 68 of 100, and worst in revenue management, scoring 57 of 100. Peru has the second largest copper reserve in the world after neighboring Chile, with an estimated 90 million metric tons in 2016.  Additionally, Peru has significant oil, gas, silver, zinc and lead reserves, all of which contribute to the prominence of extractive industries in Peruvian public policy. In the run-up to the 2018 local elections, debates on diversification and decentralization of extractive sector management have gained importance. Based on the index results, the Peruvian government should strengthen audit and oversight mechanisms, governance at the subnational level and environmental compliance.",Peru’s resource dependence is reflected in weak revenue management performance,"Across the extractive sector value chain, Peru's performance ranges between 82 of 100 in local impact and 31 of 100 in subnational revenue sharing. Peru joined the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in 2012, becoming the first Latin American and Caribbean country to be named compliant. While civil society has been pushing to broaden the EITI agenda to include beneficial ownership disclosure and environmental information, some extractive companies have resisted.","Peru's score of 64 of 100 in taxation is bolstered by clear taxation rules and hampered by lack of requirement and practice of external audit of the national tax authority, SUNAT. Beyond its commitment to the EITI process, Peru does not have a legal requirement for extractive companies to disclose tax and other payments to the government. Accountability could be strengthened with further disaggregation of reserve and exports data.
Peru is heavily dependent on natural resources; in 2015, mineral exports accounted for nearly sixty percent of the country’s total exports.  Just over five percent of government revenues  were drawn from the mining sector in 2015, down from 18 percent in 2011. According to the Atlas of Economic Complexity, metals and minerals constitute half of Peruvian exports. In the run-up to local elections taking place in 2018, debates on decentralized decision-making on extractives, dependence on resource revenues and diversification at the local level, have gained prominence.
With a score of 70 of 100 in national budgeting, Peru outperforms most neighboring countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, ranking fifth among 14 countries. This performance is a result of good budget transparency. Peru enacted a Fiscal Transparency and Prudence Law, which sets a numerical fiscal rule that caps public balance and real current expenditure, but at the end of fiscal year 2015, government expenditure ran a deficit exceeding the one percent cap. The authorities revised the targets in April 2015 due to the economic circumstances to avoid breach of the cap. The Peruvian Fiscal Council has been operational since January 2016 and is mandated to oversee compliance with the rule. Peru achieves a poor score in subnational revenue sharing due to a lack of clear rules on the responsible agencies for transferring and receiving revenues, and lack of requirements and practices for auditing subnational transfers.
",Performance gap between law and practice,"Peru achieves a good score in local impact. Following decades of environmental challenges with the mining sector, Peru’s legal framework for requirements to produce and disclose key environmental and social protection measures has improved. Nevertheless, it faces challenges in fulfilling the environmental requirements, which are the cause of persistent social conflict related to mining activities. Compliance with mine site closure and rehabilitation requirements remains an issue, and the framework for resettlement of communities could be strengthened. The effects of El Niño have raised further awareness of the issue of the impact of mining activities on water resources onto the environmental-extractives cross-sector agenda. The Peruvian Congress is debating changes to specific elements of the legislation around environmental and social issues, for instance, the legislation regarding environmental quality standards for air, soil and water.",TRUE,FALSE,,,TRUE,The Fiscal Stabilization Fund ranks in 10th place among all sovereign wealth funds in the index,"Following decades of repeated economic crises, Peru established fiscal rules and a fiscal stabilization fund (FEF) in 1999. These helped ensure that the country has low debt and savings in the fund for stabilization. As a result, the country is now better equipped to combat the effects of lower mineral revenues. Deposits into the FEF consist of surpluses from the Treasury, concessional fees, proceeds from privatization processes and interest accruing from deposits in the Peruvian Central Bank. Even though it has not yet invested in assets other than bonds issued by the Central Bank of Peru, the legal framework set by the Fiscal Transparency and Prudence Law provides that the Fund can invest in domestic and foreign assets. Generally satisfactory governance, including deposit, withdrawal and investment rules, is contrasted by a lack of strong oversight mechanisms in the absence of independent audits and legislative oversight of spending and withdrawals from the fund.

,UGA,Uganda (oil and gas),oil-and-gas,"Uganda’s oil and gas sector scores 44 of 100 in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), placing it 51st among 89 assessments in the index. This result is worsened by governance gaps in the extractive sector components and improved slightly by the enabling environment. Uganda has proven oil reserves of under two billion barrels, which attracted interest in exploration during the commodity boom of the last decade.  However, early years of exploitation have been marked by uncertainties in investment conditions, infrastructure development with neighboring countries, and resistance by local communities. Reforms are under way, aiming to address the poor or failing performance of the oil and gas sector’s licensing regime, state-owned enterprise (SOE) and revenue management, so that Uganda can create better governance conditions before it begins larger scale oil production.",Addressing weak licensing and revenue management would help Uganda bridge its governance gap to peer emerging producers,"Uganda achieves its highest component score of 47 of 100 in enabling environment. However, it achieves a failing score of 23 of 100 for control of corruption, which is crucial for good natural resource governance, pointing to a need to address issues in the country’s overall governance environment. Uganda achieves poor scores in the value realization and revenue management components; some of the governance challenges can be attributed to slow progress with investment. So far, eight oil production licenses have been issued but negotiations on final investment decisions remain ongoing, partly because of disputes over the fiscal regime. In this sense, Uganda’s first steps as an oil producer resemble those of peer emerging African oil and gas producers, Tanzania and Mozambique. Uganda performs worse than both of those countries in the index, mainly because of differences in licensing and SOE governance. However, reforms in these areas have been initiated.","Uganda set up new hydrocarbons legislation covering the upstream of the sector in 2013 and covering revenue management in 2015. Beginning in the 2015–2016 fiscal year, Uganda reformed the procedure for granting oil and gas licenses to a competitive bidding process, aided by regulations to the Petroleum (Exploration, Development and Production) Act. However, the regulations do not include requirements to publicly disclose key license allocation information, such as biddable terms. This, together with lack of contract disclosure, is reflected in Uganda’s poor score for licensing.
Uganda also achieves a poor score in revenue management. Although the country has yet to secure investment for developing the discoveries that were made a decade ago, it has taken important steps in preparing to manage future potential oil revenues. The Charter of Fiscal Responsibility, which sets a debt ceiling and a budget balance target was approved by the Ugandan Cabinet in 2016, although fiscal rules for petroleum management are yet to be applied for the period analyzed in the index. There is currently no external body tasked with overseeing compliance, although there is a Parliamentary Budget Office in place, and regulations for oil revenue management are absent. Data on budget, resource revenues and debt are available but there is no portal providing key oil sector datasets.
",Performance gap between law and practice,"Although much of Uganda’s petroleum development is not yet taking place, a gap between laws on paper and their implementation is emerging, standing at 11 points on average. In terms of local impact, this gap is a result of not publishing environmental impact assessments and mitigation plans, as required by the Petroleum Upstream Act and National Environment Management Act. Given the remote and environmentally sensitive location of the Ugandan oil blocks, this lack of sharing of information with the general public and local communities has exacerbated concerns about petroleum governance.",TRUE,TRUE,Uganda National Oil Company governance framework is under development,"The Uganda National Oil Company (NOC) was founded in 2013 and officially incorporated in 2015 to manage the state’s participation in petroleum activities, including managing the marketing of the country’s share of petroleum received in kind. The NOC is still in the formative stages and has not yet engaged in many of the activities for which it was set up. The financing arrangements are not yet finalized and the debate on the most appropriate funding mechanism is still on-going. As such, no detailed statute has been published to guide regulation of the company or provide details on the relationship between the government’s oversight and management of the NOC. This is reflected in the NOCs index ranking of fifth to last among 74 SOEs assessed, together with Sudan.",TRUE,Detailed rules for Petroleum Revenue Investment Reserve are in preparation,"Petroleum Revenue Investment Reserve (PRIR) scores 36 of 100 and ranks 21st in the index. It achieves the highest indicator score in financial reporting rules. To date, little information is published about the PRIR because Uganda is yet to deposit any funds in to the fund for purposes of investment outside of the country.

Half of Bolivia’s exports  and 30 percent of government revenues  are derived from the oil and gas sector. Oil and gas extraction in Bolivia has varied between public and private ownership over the past decade; now that the government controls the entire value chain, the degree of transparency is limited. Bolivia performs satisfactorily in most areas of the extractive decision chain, but the licensing process by the state-owned enterprise (SOE) and information and fiscal rules on budgetary process pose a risk of value being lost.",Lack of licensing and contract transparency threaten the Bolivian oil and gas sector,"Bolivia performs better than other countries in the index on average in the two extractive sector components, revenue management and value realization. However, its index score is brought down by a poor enabling environment, particularly in rule of law, where Bolivia ranks 71st among 89 assessments, with a failing score of 21 of 100. Bolivia also scores poorly in government effectiveness and regulatory quality. Extraction of oil and gas has fluctuated between public and private ownership over the past decade. Introduction of new taxes and government participation in the sector via the state-owned oil company, YPFB, in mid-2000 have helped increase revenues from the oil and gas sector. Despite Bolivia’s gas reserves amounting to 10 trillion cubic feet in 2015,  the recent slowdown in investment and a need to renegotiate the gas supply contract with Brazil is expected to lead to a new hydrocarbons law that is more open to private investment.","To address transparency and predictability concerns in the context of policy change, the RGI results point to licensing as the weakest link in Bolivia’s oil and gas sector decision chain. According to the Bolivian Constitution, YPFB has sole authority to conduct exploration and exploitation activities. YPFB may sign service contracts with companies to conduct activities in exchange for a fee or payment for their services. YPFB is in charge of the bidding process or direct negotiation, and even though minimum technical and financial criteria for companies are defined by a ministerial resolution, YPFB does not actually publish information about these negotiation processes on its website. Bolivia disclosed many oil and gas contracts in 2006, but has subsequently withdrawn some of them. Beneficial owners of extractive companies are not disclosed, in contrast, Bolivia has an effective system of revealing public officials’ patrimony, rents and participation in companies. ",Direction of travel on key resource governance questions between 2012 and 2016,"Bolivia has two subnational resource revenue sharing systems: sharing oil and gas income from royalties and patents on oil concessions with producing areas; and sharing revenue from the direct tax on hydrocarbons with producing and non-producing areas, including all levels of government, public universities, cash transfers and special purposes funds. Bolivia scores 62 of 100 and ranks eighth among 89 assessments in subnational revenue sharing, with a 16-point gap to the best performer in this area, Brazil. This result is explained by Bolivia’s transparent regime and disclosure of actual payments, although it could further improve by introducing a legal requirement to publicly disclose audit results on payments made to subnational governments and disclose the use of received revenues by the subnational authorities. A discussion on a “fiscal pact” on decentralization of revenue management has been on-going in Bolivia for nearly a decade, and demand for more distribution of revenues has, at times, created political tension. Environmental issues play a large role in the debate around the sector, reflected in the weak performance in local impact and lack of progress in disclosing results of environmental impact assessments and consultations.",TRUE,TRUE,YPFB improved in transparency but sales data and social expenditures remain hidden,"YPFB scores 70 of 100 and ranks 12th in the index and sixth among ten SOEs assessed in Latin America and the Caribbean. In contrast to the lack of transparency in YPFB’s contracting process, it regularly reports on sector activities and its relationship with the government. It is required to sell gas to the domestic energy market in the first instance, and the area where YPFB could improve in transparency relates to fulfillment of these objectives and general disclosure of sales data to domestic and external markets.

Azerbaijan achieves weak scores in value realization and enabling environment, and its performance is lowered further by a poor score in revenue management. Oil constituted nearly 90 percent  of Azerbaijan’s total exports in 2015 and the country depends on oil for more than half of its budget revenues, making it one of the most resource-dependent economies in Eurasia. The economy is not well diversified beyond hydrocarbons. Currency devaluations in recent years highlight a need for proper management of extractive revenues. Azerbaijan has made some progress in transparency, but this is under threat following the government’s decision to withdraw from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in early 2017 and in the context of a limited civic space.","In the absence of robust rules, Azerbaijan’s disclosure practices are in danger following government withdrawal from EITI","Azerbaijan’s performance in the RGI is characterized by unevenness across the extractive sector decision chain. Scores range between a failing 28 of 100 in licensing to a satisfactory 70 of 100 in state-owned enterprise (SOE) governance. The licensing process is managed by the state-owned oil company of Azerbaijan (SOCAR), which acts on behalf of the state to agree on the terms of production sharing agreements (PSAs) with contractors. In the absence of rules or general terms for these agreements, texts of approved agreements are published only after ratification by parliament. The full texts of all PSAs are not disclosed.","With diminishing petroleum reserves and falling oil prices, Azerbaijan is facing the challenge of declining production and revenues. The country did not effectively manage its oil wealth during the oil price boom years, and as a result, use of petroleum revenues from the sovereign wealth fund (SWF) as well as budget revenues have been volatile. The government’s long-term strategy on the management of oil and gas revenues provides expenditure rules, but these are pronounced by decree rather than legislation, and lack detailed implementation rules. There is no requirement for external oversight of the expenditure rule, explaining the poor result in this subcomponent. Furthermore, budget transparency is lacking, as full budget data are not disclosed and data on the national debt are unsatisfactory. Furthermore, there is no portal providing key oil sector datasets, such as those on reserves, production and exports.
In early 2017, Azerbaijan withdrew from the EITI following the EITI board’s decision to suspend it due to a lack of satisfactory progress on civil society engagement. This decision together with Azerbaijan’s weak score for the voice and accountability element of enabling environment, reflects the shrinking space for civil society organizations in the country.
",Performance gap between law and practice,"In contrast to most countries in the index, Azerbaijan performs significantly better in indicators measuring practice and disclosure than those measuring rules and regulations. However, withdrawal from the EITI jeopardizes the progress that Azerbaijan has made over the past five years in disclosing information on oil and gas reserves, production and exports and most importantly, payments by oil and gas companies to the government, as the EITI has facilitated and upheld disclosure in the absence of a strong legal framework demanding it. This reinforces the importance that EITI has had on practices. Beyond areas required by the EITI, such as disclosure of contracts, Azerbaijan has not demonstrated improvements in transparency, which makes it difficult for citizens to assess the terms by which resources are extracted. A recently established Extractives Transparency Commission creates some hopes for future transparency and accountability, but it is not clear to what extent this transparency and accountability will be ensured and the EITI Standard is used as a benchmark.",TRUE,TRUE,"SOCAR in top two Eurasian SOEs, while SOFAZ lacks oversight of spending and investment","Azerbaijan’s SOE, SOCAR, scores a satisfactory 70 of 100 and ranks 13th among 74 SOEs assessed in the index. SOCAR is the second-highest performing SOE in Eurasia after Ukraine’s Naftogaz. Its relatively good position in the index is driven by disclosures facilitated by the EITI Standard. Disclosures of payments to government, spending on non-operational activities, and in particular, fairly advanced information on commodity sales, including names of those who have bought the government’s share of oil, are all disclosed through EITI reports. These disclosures are now under threat following withdrawal from the EITI.

SOFAZ was set up in 1999 as an extra-budgetary institution. The revenues of the fund are generated by the sale of the state’s share in hydrocarbons, bonuses paid by investors, acreage payments, dividends, export revenues, grants and other inflows. SOFAZ’s asset utilization program limits expenditures from the fund to the most important nation-wide projects, such as construction and reconstruction of strategically significant infrastructure facilities for the purpose of the socioeconomic progress of Azerbaijan. The sovereign wealth fund (SWF) was intended as a savings and stabilization fund, and it has set aside approximately USD 34 billion so far — 28 percent of total assets collected during the oil boom.
SOFAZ publishes annual reports and discloses information about the size, deposits, spending and investments of the fund, earning good scores on disclosures. However, on the legal framework side, the fund does not have clear rules on withdrawals, though the government is currently in the process of drafting “golden rules” for the fund, or strong oversight mechanisms, causing SOFAZ to achieve weak or failing scores in these areas. SOFAZ is ultimately controlled by the President of Azerbaijan, and the parliament has no role in oversight of SOFAZ’s budget or investment decisions.

Iraq’s performance across the extractive sector value chain ranges between 73 of 100 in taxation to 33 of 100 in local impact.,"The index results point to a need for increased accountability and transparency in the oil and gas sector. Iraq also ranked fourth to last in the 2015 Open Budget Index. However, reporting according to Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) requirements has improved the availability of key sector data, which is reflected in the satisfactory score in taxation. The Iraqi government invited companies to bid for small- and medium-sized oil fields in 2016 but results of the round were not available at the time of assessment. Before that, the last bidding round took place in 2012. A poor score of 35 of 100 in licensing could be improved by adhering to the requirement to disclose public officials’ interests in extractive companies set out in the Integrity Commission Law, developing beneficial ownership disclosure practices and disclosing all contracts. Similarly, poor performance in local impact could be addressed by strengthening compliance with environmental rehabilitation rules and protecting land-users and owners.",Direction of travel on key resource governance questions between 2012 and 2016,"Information on annual budget and expenditures is available but the Iraqi government has not set binding rules constraining spending and saving decisions, despite depending on oil revenues to finance its annual budget. Revenues distributed to subnational governments are governed by Federal Budget Law, and set at USD 5 for each barrel of oil produced and each 150 million cubic feet of natural gas produced. Though revenues shared are disclosed, these flows are not audited by an independent body, and complaints over the balance of authority at the local and federal level persist. Even if the current conflict subsides, divisions and disputes that were overshadowed by the conflict may resurface, including the status of disputed territories between the Kurdistan region and federal Iraq, and calls for decentralization of government control. These issues are likely to resurface, especially in the Ninewah and southern provinces, and any devolution of power could prompt demands from similar communities throughout Iraq. Practical steps towards decentralization are expected to be taken by the government in 2017, and in Kurdistan, top political parties have agreed to hold a non-binding referendum on independence.",TRUE,TRUE,Reform in Iraqi SOEs has potential but current reporting practices are poor,"With a score of 66 of 100 in SOEs, Iraq outperforms most neighboring countries in the Middle East and North Africa region, ranking third among 16 countries assessed. The Ministry of Oil renamed the South Oil Company – which is responsible for 80 percent of Iraq’s oil production – as the Basra Oil Company. It does not publish annual reports on finances and operations, but transfers to government are disclosed via EITI reports. The South Oil Company performs better than most companies assessed in the index in commodity sales rules, as a policy document published by the oil ministry and Iraq Oil Marketing Company (SOMO) defines the rules for selecting buyers and defining the prices of marketed oil.
In addition, the Iraq National Oil Company is being re-established as part of an effort to reorganize and restructure its operations. The Ministry of Oil is also working on setting up a national gas company and a national refineries company. If a new draft law that is currently in Parliament is passed, all the existing regional national entities now responsible for oil and gas developments could become subsidiaries of a new Iraq National Oil Company. It also established a fifth national oil company, the Dhi-Qar Oil Company.

Satisfactory performance in enabling environment is offset by weak performance in value realization and revenue management. However, timely publication of financial reports and additional disclosures, including the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), have led to improvements in the transparency of the Philippine Mineral Development Corporation. The mining sector contributes 4.4 percent to the Philippines's exports  and with 60,000 metric tons of nickel produced in 2016,  the Philippines is among the top ten global producers of nickel; this assessment therefore focuses on nickel. ",Improved reporting contrasts shortcomings in the governance of local impacts in the Philippines,"The Philippines RGI score is boosted by a satisfactory enabling environment, which is driven by government effectiveness where the country achieves a good score of 79 of 100. However, in the subcomponent assessing political stability and absence of violence, the Philippines achieves a poor score. Across the policy areas in the extractive sector decision chain, the Philippines's performance varies considerably, from 70 of 100 in state-owned enterprises (SOE) to 36 of 100 in local impact.","The Philippines scores 56 of 100 and ranks second in licensing, one point below Australia whose licensing system ranks highest in the Asia Pacific region. The country has committed to disclosing beneficial owners of extractive companies in its EITI roadmap, and the Constitution together with a Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees require public officials to disclose their assets, liabilities and net worth. While the Philippine’s taxation performance is satisfactory, it needs to address the challenge of oversight as the tax agency, Bureau of Internal Revenue, is not subjected to external revenue audit due to a Presidential Executive Order limiting the power of the Commission on Audit to a performance audit instead of revenue audit.
Over the past five years, the Philippines has made progress in transparency in several key areas. Some contracts are disclosed via the Philippine EITI resource contracts portal, and the level of disaggregation in reporting on company payments and revenue sharing with subnational authorities is supported by EITI reporting. It has also made progress in the Open Budget Index over the same period. However, much progress is yet to be made in disclosing environmental and social impact assessments, as well as in mitigating the harms faced by local communities as well as the benefits they should derive from mining activities.
",Direction of travel on key resource governance questions between 2012 and 2016,"Weak revenue management performance is a result of the Philippines' performance in national budgeting and revenue sharing, scoring 53 and 51 of 100, respectively. The Philippines does not have a fiscal rule enshrined in law, but the Philippine Development Plan sets targets for fiscal deficits, revenues and expenditure which the government has adhered to, though there has not been an independent monitoring of these targets. Similarly, reported adherence to revenue sharing formulae and disclosure of revenues shared would gain credibility with independent audits. ",TRUE,TRUE,Financial and operational reporting together with EITI result in satisfactory SOE governance,"With a score of 70 of 100, the Philippines outperforms most neighboring countries in the Asia Pacific region in SOE governance, ranking third among 15 countries, behind India and Indonesia’s mining sector. The mandate of the Philippine Mining Development Corporation (PMDC) is to conduct activities across the mining value chain in gold, silver, copper, iron, and other minerals. Its mandate is not to compete with the private sector but to facilitate mining in areas were the private sector has difficulty operating. Currently, PMDC do not directly operate mines. Rather, it is contracting the private sector to conduct its operation in the areas under the supervision of PMDC.
PMDC published its audited financial reports for the financial year 2015 in a timely manner, and payments made to the government are disclosed via the country's EITI reports. However, PMDC does not have any rules nor does it report on how its contractors sell the commodities they produce, creating a gap to best practice in commodity sales.

Satisfactory performance in value realization is offset by poor performance in revenue management. Ukraine's hydrocarbon reserves amount to 395 million barrels of oil  and 39 trillion cubic feet of gas.  In 2014, Ukraine ranked fourth in Europe by volume of gas produced.  Nevertheless, it is a net importer of natural gas and has historically been dependent on Russian gas. The annexation of Crimea into Russia in 2014 and the resulting tension between the two countries has led Ukraine to diversify its gas sources. Following a 2015 government decree, the state-owned enterprise (SOE), Naftogaz, is required to sell its production to domestic refineries and is only allowed to export the surplus.","Addressing corruption, local impact and revenue management could potentially improve resource governance in Ukraine","Ukraine ranks fourth among nine countries in the Eurasia region covered in the index, following Mongolia, Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. Ukraine performs best in value realization, with a satisfactory score of 61 of 100, and worst in revenue management, with a poor score of 40 of 100. Ukraine’s enabling environment score of 45 of 100 is hampered by failing political stability and control of corruption. Ukraine’s scores between subcomponents along the extractive sector decision chain range from poor in local impact and national budgeting to good in SOE governance. ","Ukraine scores satisfactorily and ranks second in the index in licensing. It has an online license registry, and amendments adopted in 2016 to the procedures for granting licenses for the use of subsoil resources and the respective auctions, created a basis for competitive and transparent licensing. It is one of few countries in the world where the law requires participating companies to disclose their ultimate beneficiaries. However, only half of the companies covered reported their beneficial owners in the 2015 Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) report.
To address these gaps, the government is working on reforms to improve transparency in the extractive industry. The parliament is in the process of reviewing the amended Law on Disclosure of Information in the Extractive Sector. This law seeks to enforce reporting on beneficial owners by introducing a penalty for non-compliance. Ukraine is also researching a beneficial owner verification mechanism as part of an International Monetary Fund loan requirement. The law under review also proposes to create a legal requirement for disclosing contracts currently closed from the public under the legislation.
",Performance gap between law and practice,"Ukraine and Botswana are the only countries in the index where average performance between indicators measuring laws and regulations, and those measuring practices and disclosures, is equal. However, in local impact, where Ukraine scores a poor 43 of 100, compliance and disclosure lag behind requirements set out in the Subsoil Code. The law requires preparation of environmental impact assessments but lacks a requirement to publicly disclose them. This means that the public cannot assess the environmental impact of the extractive sector. Overall, information about environmental issues is sparse, though some provisions for violation of environmental principles are enshrined in the Subsoil Code.
Ukraine’s track record in budget openness varies. The country discloses annual budgets and expenditures, earning full scores on budget openness indicators in the RGI, but its score of 46 of 100 places it in the mid-range of countries measured in the Open Budget Index. Ukraine will start implementing a recently passed law on sub-national resource revenue sharing from January 2018, and enshrining strong transparency and accountability mechanisms will be a key for success. Ukraine should improve oversight mechanisms of the revenue collection and sharing process, as it is one of the only countries in the index that does not require or conduct audits of the tax authority.
",TRUE,TRUE,Naftogaz ranks in the top 10 SOE’s but should improve reporting on gas subsidies and sales,"Ukraine’s Naftogaz ranks in the top 10 of all SOEs assessed and is the best performing SOE in the Eurasia region with a score of 76 of 100. It performs satisfactorily in indicators measuring operational and financial reporting. Good performance in existence of commodity sales rules is a result of a requirement to prioritise domestic energy producers before exporting gas, but its reports do not include detailed information on the sales to these customers. Similarly, Naftogaz achieves its worst indicator score in SOE non-operational activities, which it engages in by subsidizing household gas prices without disclosing the cost of these subsidies. In addition, in the downstream of the value chain, Naftogaz has been involved in a procurement corruption scandal.

Oil constituted nearly all of its exports  before the internal conflict that followed the end of former President Muammar Gaddafi’s regime. Libya’s oil production has suffered significantly as a result of the conflict. Failing governance can be attributed to the enabling environment; Libya also ranks in the bottom five in several policy areas along the decision chain.

Libya has been torn between factions based in Tripoli and the east, each spawning rival institutions, governments, and armed forces, all competing for power. A struggle for control over Libya’s oil is threatening to undermine the new UN-backed government’s fragile stability, and the country is pressed with challenges of political, economic and social stability, including rebuilding infrastructure and economic diversification.","Across the policy areas in the extractive sector value chain, Libya's performance varies between 58 of 100 in taxation and 7 of 100 in licensing.

In 2013, a new committee was announced to update the Petroleum Law and to launch a new licensing round, but the results of the committee's work have not been published amidst the political turmoil. Rules about the terms for production sharing agreements between the national oil company and private companies are disclosed in the Model Production Sharing Agreement (PSA). Production shares, bonuses and term are not specified in the PSA but left to be specified for each contract. Furthermore, it is unclear how many contracts follow the PSA model, and how many are direct concessions granted by the Ministry. There is a 16-point gap between Libya’s score for indicators measuring laws and regulations and its score for implementation and enforcement.",Performance gap between law and practice,"Libya scores a failing nine of 100 in national budgeting. No fiscal rules are set and very sparse information about revenues and expenditures of the government is available via the 2014 budget law and report by the national audit bureau. Oil production is only operating at a fraction of its potential, as a result of which revenues have dropped substantially, leading to large and unsustainable budget deficit. If oil prices and production do not increase markedly, at this rate of spending Libya will require either significant external financing or will be forced to withdraw savings from its sovereign wealth fund (SWF).",TRUE,TRUE,Libya National Oil Corporation scores joint fourth lowest of 16 SOEs in the MENA region,"Despite having two governments and being on the brink of civil war, the National Oil Corporation (NOC) and the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) have succeeded in continuing operations, to an extent.

The Libyan NOC scores 32 of 100 and ranks 58th, together with Oman's SOE, among 74 SOEs in the index, compared to a global average of 49 of 100 in the SOE subcomponent. The NOC achieves its highest indicator score in rules governing fiscal transfers between the SOE and the government, which are set out in the law establishing the NOC.

Its assets, standing at USD 67 billion, were initially frozen and political groups have struggled to control key appointments and positions within the LIA. The current conflict and fiscal crisis in Libya—along with continued constraints on LIA investments imposed by the United Nations Security Council, underscore the need for improved governance rules for the LIA, accounting, and oversight requirements to prevent leakages and excessive risk-taking. They are also needed to safeguard the LIA’s role as an institution that protects the Libyan peoples’ endowment for the future.

Liberia is a low-income country with a population of under five million and a gross domestic product per capita of USD 460.  It has 900,000 metric tons of iron ore reserves and was one of Africa’s top iron ore producers before the civil war, which ended in 2003.  Iron ore production subsequently resumed in 2011, as did investment in other natural resources, including gold and timber, as well as oil and gas exploration. In the fiscal year 2013–2014, the extractive industries constituted 15 percent of gross domestic product and 26 percent of government revenue.

The mining sector constitutes 35 percent of its total exports  and with nickel reserves standing at 1.5 million tons,  Madagascar has the potential to continue growing its mining sector. The government could alleviate opposition to environmental impacts and concerns over equitable sharing of benefits by closing the gap between the mining legal framework and its implementation, particularly in regard to local impact and subnational revenue sharing. ",Licensing is Madagascar’s weakest link in governing its mineral resources,"Madagascar’s mining sector operates in a poor environment characterized by government ineffectiveness resulting from a combination of lack of control of corruption and limited resources. Although Madagascar’s 2005 Mining Code follows international standards, the sector performs consistently poorly in resource governance, scoring 36 of 100 in value realization and 34 of 100 in revenue management.

The UK has proven oil reserves of 2,800 million barrels and gas reserves of 7 trillion cubic feet. The oil and gas sector constitutes eight percent of the UK’s exports. Many global oil companies are headquartered in London and the UK government’s recent progress in mandatory disclosure requirements has the potential to positively impact transparency on payments by oil companies to governments around the world. The UK oil and gas sector is second only to Norway’s in the index, it could improve by disclosing details of licensing, ownership and environmental documentation.",United Kingdom leads in taxation and company payment transparency,"The UK oil and gas sector scores 95 of 100 and ranks fourth in the enabling environment component, behind Norway, Canada and Australia. The UK’s performance in the two extractive sector components, value extraction and revenue management, is satisfactory. The sector’s performance in the subcomponents along the extractive sector value chain varies between a score of 92 of 100 in taxation and 56 of 100 in local impact.","The UK oil and gas sector achieves the index’s joint highest score in taxation, together with Tanzania’s oil and gas sector. This is the result of clear tax rules, comprehensive audits, and timely and disaggregated disclosure of sector data. Indeed, the UK is one of only six countries in the index that require and actively disclose payments from companies to the government, separated by companies, projects and payment type. To this end, the UK implemented the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and in 2014, adopted the Report on Payments to Governments Regulations and the Financial Conduct Authority’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules (Reports on Payments to Governments) instrument, which implement Chapter 10 of the EU Accounting Directive and Article 6 of the EU Transparency Directive, respectively.
However, the UK lags behind the OECD average scores in local impact, scoring a weak 56 of 100. This is because the government does not disclose environmental and social impact assessments and environmental mitigation management plans for onshore projects, although these have been disclosed for the majority of offshore projects. These issues contrast with the UK’s generally balanced performance between indicators measuring the legal framework and it’s implementation, with an average four-point difference.
Similarly, the UK has not disclosed onshore contracts following the 14th onshore licensing round in 2015.
",Direction of travel on key resource governance questions between 2012 and 2016,"The UK’s satisfactory score of 68 of 100 in the national budgeting subcomponent is a result of transparent budget information and the existence of a fiscal rule, which aims at fiscal balance based on a rolling, five-year forecast.

The UK does not have a data portal with centralized oil and gas data.
The UK does not have a state-owned enterprise or sovereign wealth fund in the oil and gas sector, although the The Oil and Gas Authority became a state-owned company in 2016 (not assessed in the RGI); the UK government does not transfer resource revenues to subnational authorities.

This assessment focuses on the Gulf of Mexico, the US’s main oil producing area. The US as a whole produces 15 percent of the world’s oil,  and following a shale gas revolution, over 20 percent of the world’s natural gas.  As home to some of the world’s largest oil companies, the impacts of resource governance in the US reverberate well beyond the operations taking place on or off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The US has led the way in setting a better standard of resource governance in some instances; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is cited as having significantly improved how US-headquartered extraction companies operate around the world. Furthermore, section 1504 of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act promised to increase transparency of company-government financial relations, although actual implementation has been subject to major delays, most recently with the disapproval of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) implementing rule in early 2017.","US’s declining global leadership is evident as it falls behind other OECD members in tax, payment transparency","The RGI measures the state of governance during 2016. At that point, US governance of the Gulf of Mexico’s oil was relatively good, apart from some notable weaknesses, including transparency related to environmental issues and subnational resource revenue sharing. Overall satisfactory index performance is supported by the enabling environment component, scoring 93 of 100 and ranking fifth in the index. The US ranks second in the index in open data, with a score of 95 of 100. Satisfactory performance in revenue management is boosted by national budgeting, ranking ninth with a satisfactory score of 70 of 100.","Across the subcomponents in the extractive sector value chain, the US oil and gas sector’s performance varies between 84 of 100 in taxation and 50 of 100 in local impact. The US oil and gas sector ranks third in taxation, behind the United Kingdom and Norway – both of which have advanced reporting practices on extractive company payments, particularly on tax payments. In contrast, the US Revenue Act requires reporting on payments in the aggregate, but not taxes on a company-by-company basis.
Until the end of 2016 the US was a leader in the global movement to improve transparency over payments from oil companies to governments, however, in early 2017, following the inauguration of the new president, the new administration and Congress disapproved the SEC rule implementing Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The US is an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) candidate, but its EITI roadmap for 2020 does not include satisfactory plans to disclose the identities of beneficial owners of resource companies, creating another cause for concern, in addition to the lack of company-level tax reporting. The US government has also postponed a meeting of the US EITI multi-stakeholder group, calling the government’s commitment to implement the EITI into question.
",Performance gap between law and practice,"The US’s weak score on local impact is a result of the National Environmental Policy Act’s weak rules on social impact assessments and environmental mitigation plans, however, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) does disclose environmental impact assessments. A similar pattern emerges in licensing, where the rules governing the sealed-bid lease sales process for the Gulf of Mexico blocks do not require disclosure of details on bid outcomes. In practice, details on blocks and their operators are made available via the cadaster of the Federal Register. For the Gulf of Mexico, a combination of BOEM data center resources provide information on rights and lease details, although this information is disaggregated and not easy to interpret. The US’s score for indicators measuring laws and regulations is 20 points higher than its score for implementation and enforcement – the third widest gap in the index.
* The rules and practices assessed in the US oil and gas sector vary greatly between private, state-owned and federal land within the United States. Where these differ, the assessment is based on federal offshore extraction in the Gulf of Mexico, the largest producer of oil and gas in the United States.

Furthermore, the oil and gas sector performs particularly well in subnational resource revenue sharing, ranking first place, reflecting a high degree of transparency in revenue sharing. Oil and gas sector rents constituted less than one per cent of Brazil's gross domestic product in 2015, down from over three percent in 2012.  The government expected rapid economic growth after developing the giant pre-salt oil resources that were discovered a decade ago. Instead, a combination of low oil prices and corruption charges resulting in a political crisis have led to a slowdown in Brazil’s economic growth since 2015. ",Brazil performs well in revenue management but there is room for improvement in value realization,"Brazil's performance in the index is fairly balanced along the extractives sector value chain, with better performance in the revenue management component than in the value realization component. Overall, Brazil’s oil and gas sector receives a satisfactory score in the enabling environment component due to its relatively low scores for control of corruption and political stability and the absence of violence. Brazil scores a satisfactory 61 of 100 points in licensing and achieves good scores of between 88 and 100 points in all indicators measuring the transparency of rules and practices of the licensing process and results. The licensing score is hindered by the lack of requirements and practices for contract and beneficial ownership disclosure – scoring 0 of 100 points in those indicators.

Brazil could improve its taxation score by disclosing extractive company payments to the government. International best practice is rapidly moving towards project-by-project reporting on all revenue streams generated by the extractive sector. However, Brazil currently only reports on revenues aggregated for the whole economy – that is, not separated by sector, company or payment type.",Performance gap between law and practice,"Brazil’s good performance in the revenue management component is the result of a top performance in subnational revenue sharing. Regulations determine that five to 10 per cent of oil or gas royalties should be paid monthly to each producing area, with separate formulae for onshore and offshore production and an additional compensation mechanism depending on geological risks and production expectations. The Brazilian National Petroleum Agency (ANP) publishes the amount of revenues transferred to subnational governments in its annual report, giving Brazil a full score of 100 points in the indicators measuring disclosure of shared revenues.
Brazil also achieves a good score in national budgeting. The government’s 2000 Fiscal Responsibility Law provides a debt rule and an expenditure rule. The Federal Audit Court reviewed the government's adherence to the fiscal rule in 2015 and found that it was not followed in that year. Data on budget and debt are available, but not on oil revenues.

While Brazil performs well in overall resource governance, Petrobras achieves only low scores in indicators measuring its commodity sales disclosures, non-operational activities and fiscal transfers between itself and the government.
Furthermore, there are exceptions in the general licensing process which favor Petrobras. According to the Profit Sharing Law governing pre-salt and strategic deposits, the federal government awards production sharing contracts for these areas directly to Petrobras, without a bidding process. In the case of a tie in a general bidding process, the license is granted to Petrobras as per the Oil Law.

This overall score is lowered by a poor score in the enabling environment component. Even though both extractive sector components, value realization and revenue management, achieve similar scores, there is great variation in performance at the subcomponent level. The oil and gas sector constituted 98 percent of exports and 97 percent of government revenues in 2013, making this sector a key facilitator of economic development. ",Uneven performance between policy areas for Timor Leste,"Timor Leste’s oil and gas sector has one of the widest ranges between subcomponent scores observed in the index. This pattern is repeated throughout the governance components. In the enabling environment component, Timor Leste is the third-highest ranking country in the voice and accountability subcomponent in the Asia Pacific region, after Australia and India, this contrasts with the country ranking second to last in rule of law and regulatory quality in the region, above only Myanmar. ","Timor Leste achieves a satisfactory taxation score within the value realization component as a result of disclosure of production, export and company payment data and clear tax rules. The government could improve by carrying out independent audits of extractive companies and the national tax authority. In contrast, Timor Leste fails at governing the local impacts of the extractive sector because it does not disclose environmental impact assessments, as required by law. This also contributes to the six-point difference between the average score for indicators assessing laws and rules, and those assessing practices.  ",Performance gap between law and practice,"Within the revenue management component, Timor Leste ranks 79th among 89 assessments with a score of 25 of 100 points in national budgeting. Budget and resource revenue data are disclosed, but debt levels are not, and there is no centralized data portal with key sector datasets.

The country’s economy is heavily dependent on diamond mining; the sector contributes 83 percent to exports.  Though Botswana’s diamond reserves are estimated at over 300 million carats, they are being depleted at a rate that puts future of economic benefits from the sector in question.  Most of the sector is controlled by the government’s joint venture company, Debswana, which achieves a score of 29 out of 100 due to failing reporting practices.",Botswana’s satisfactory performance driven by good enabling environment,"Botswana’s strong regional performance in the index—it ranks second in sub-Saharan Africa, after Ghana’s oil and gas sector—is driven primarily by its enabling environment. It is the only country in the region scoring above 80 of 100 points in enabling environment, and several enabling environment indicators rank in the overall top 10 of the index, including rule of law, control of corruption and political stability. Botswana also scores satisfactorily in revenue management.","However, the country’s good performance in enabling environment is offset by poor performance in value realization, where Botswana scores 40 of 100 points and ranks 68th of 89. Botswana's performance is considerably varied across the policy areas in the extractive sector value chain, ranging from a satisfactory score of 67 of 100 points in local impact to a failing score of 18 of 100 in licensing.

It ranks seventh among nine countries assessed in the Eurasian region, outperforming Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Its poor performance is driven by failing enabling environment. The country’s iron ore reserves total 111 million metric tons,  but the development of the largest untapped iron ore deposit in Eurasia, the Hajigak Iron Ore project, has been delayed. Mining is reported to have represented just one percent  of total exports in 2015, but significant underrepporting of some minerals, and a predominantly domestic market for others, make exact figures difficult to obtain.  ",Afghanistan’s political instability complicates attempts to improve resource governance,"Instability and poor governance are the primary factors in Afghanistan’s failing performance in enabling environment and make it the worst performer in that component in the Eurasia region. Political conflicts and insurgencies (in-country and regional) drastically complicate efforts to improve resource governance; the country scores only 2 of 100 points in political stability (compared to the regional average of 44) and scores badly in control of corruption and rule of law. The concession for developing the Hajigak deposit was awarded to a consortium of Indian companies, but due to instability the agreement remains unconcluded and the project was not yet producing during the RGI’s assessment period (see below for a note on the RGI’s methodology).","Afghanistan’s highest component score is in value realization, thanks to satisfactory taxation rules and local impact requirements. However, serious limitations applied to these requirements undermine the satisfactory score; the environmental and social requirements do not apply to medium- and small-scale operations, while none of the large concessions to which these requirements would apply are in operation yet. In addition to the Hajigak project, a large copper concession in Mes Aynak awarded to a Chinese state-owned enterprise has been delayed for various reasons (including its threat to historical and cultural sites). Not enough information is available to verify whether the environmental and social impact assessments have been conducted for these large-scale projects.
Afghanistan performs poorly in national budgeting and subnational revenue sharing. The country can bolster a culture of transparency by making comprehensive actual and projected natural resource revenue data publicly available, though the Afghanistan Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative has increased the availability of information on some projects. The gap between the quality of Afghanistan’s laws and regulations and their implementation is nine points. This gap is particularly visible in subnational revenue sharing, where rules are enshrined in law; but transferred revenues have not been disclosed or audited.

The country has oil reserves of 12,000 million barrels and gas reserves of 160 trillion cubic feet , with 94 percent of exports coming from the oil and gas sector.  Despite a gross domestic product per capita of approximately $4,000, Algeria is one of the world’s poorest countries measured by the multidimenisonal poverty index. In the last decade, the sector has failed to attract significant new investment from international oil companies and to maintain an adequate reserve replacement ratio through the development of new oil and gas fields.","In an otherwise poorly-governed sector, Algeria performs well in the index’s licensing subcomponent  ","Algeria performs best in the index’s value realization category, with a poor score of 40 of 100 points. Subcomponent scores vary considerably: While Algeria performs weakly in taxation and state-owned enterprises, it fails in local impact and ranks 74th of ¬¬¬89 assessments. Algeria can improve its local impact performance by following rules on requiring and disclosing environmental and social impact assessments, conducting environmental impact analyses and compensating land owners and users. Across the value chain, Algeria performs worst in revenue management, with a failing score of 25 of 100 points. This can be attributed to an absence of fiscal rules, limited data on debt and the absence of an open data portal featuring key extractive sector datasets. ","In 2013, the Algerian parliament approved the introduction of fiscal incentives to attract foreign companies and encourage them to take on new ventures, particularly in offshore exploration of shale gas. To that end, Algeria opened a new set of oil and gas fields to international bidders in January 2014. The tender, launched by Algeria's state-owned oil licensing body, Alnaft, covered 33 concessions, but only five were awarded. This competitive bidding process (accompanied by rules set out in legislation) leads to good scores for the bidding process pre-award; otherwise, Algeria’s licensing performance is poor.  ",Performance gap between law and practice,"The small difference in scores between legal requirements and their practical implementation is undermined by low scores in local impact, where Algeria does not comply with rules set for disclosing environmental impact assessments and mitigation management plans.

Independent researchers, overseen by NRGI, in each of the 81 countries completed a questionnaire to gather primary data on value realization and revenue management. For the third component, the RGI draws on external data from over 20 international organizations. The assessment covers the period 2015-2016.

,VEN,Venezuela (oil and gas),oil-and-gas,"Venezuela’s oil and gas sector scores 33 of 100 points and ranks 74th of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index. This poor performance is driven by its failing enabling environment where Venezuela ranks 80th with a score of 17. Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves—300 billion barrels of oil  and 200 trillion cubic feet of gas —and the oil and gas sector constitutes 98 percent of total exports . As the most resource-dependent country in the Latin American and Caribbean region, improving the governance of the natural resource sector—in particular the governance of its enabling environment—holds significant developmental potential for the country",Venezuela performs weakly in value realization due to poor regulation and legislation ,"Venezuela has the lowest-performing enabling environment in Latin America, failing regulatory quality and rule of law. It performs weakly in value realization, scoring 48 of 100 points. Venezuela’s revenue management performance is also poor, in large part because of the failing governance of Venezuela’s sovereign wealth fund. Opportunities for Venezuela to capitalize on its vast resource wealth lie in part in implementing a cadaster and adopting and enforcing rules related to disclosing license winners and details of the process, financial interests in the sector, and extractive company contracts.","The global drop in oil prices has led to a severe economic crisis and hyperinflation. The Ley Orgánica de Administración Financiera del Sector Público put in place in 2003 was designed to establish multi-year maximum spending levels and debt ceilings. Its implementation has been consecutively delayed via transitory clauses to postpone binding fiscal rules. There is no external body tasked with overseeing compliance. Enforcing the fiscal rule to manage fluctuations in resource revenues would improve Venezuela’s budget balance and bridge the gap between laws/regulations and their implementation. Implementation challenges are also prevalent in the sharing of petroleum revenues with subnational authorities (as required by the constitutional appropriation and the law on special economic allocations originating from mines and hydrocarbons). The rules of these allocations are clear, but the amounts of actual transfers and audits of them have not been publicly disclosed.",Performance gap between law and practice,,TRUE,TRUE,Petróleos de Venezuela is on the right track with disclosures,"Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), scores a weak 58 of 100 points. It ranks 27th among 74 SOEs in the index, 21st of 52 oil and gas SOEs and 13th of 14 assessments in Latin America and the Caribbean. PDVSA’s fiscal transfers to the government are governed by rules and it reports on such transfers. It also discloses information about production and finances, including joint ventures and subsidiaries. The main weaknesses lie in the risks posed by wide-ranging non-operational activities, such as social programs and investments in non-oil sector subsidiaries. A key governance challenge is to develop requirements and practices for incrased transparency on commodity sales, the main source of government finances.",TRUE,,"Despite boasting the world’s largest oil resources, Venezuela has failed to use its main sovereign wealth fund, Fondo de Desarollo Nacional, to save and/or invest a significant proportion of oil revenues. The fund scores 22 of 100 points. It ranks 26th of 34 funds in the index, last in Latin America and 20th of 28 assessed funds in oil and gas sectors. Deposits into the Fondo de Desarollo Nacional are rules-based, but an absence of rules governing withdrawals and deposits has allowed for the mismanagement of funds. The fund is required to report on its finances to the parliament and the public. Reports have not been published, but an annual accounting report prepared by the Ministry of Economy and Finance provides some audited financial information on Financial Year 2014.",,,33,"What is the RGI?
  
The 2017 RGI assesses how 81 resource-rich countries govern their oil, gas and mineral wealth. The index composite score is made up of three components. Two measure key characteristics of the extractives sector – value realization and revenue management – and a third captures the broader context of governance — the enabling environment. These three overarching dimensions of governance consist of 14 subcomponents, which comprise 51 indicators, which are calculated by aggregating 133 questions.
